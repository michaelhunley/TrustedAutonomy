# Trusted Autonomy -- User Guide

**Version**: v0.4.4-alpha

Trusted Autonomy (TA) is a governance wrapper for AI agents. It lets any agent work freely in an isolated workspace, then holds the proposed changes at a human review checkpoint before anything takes effect. You see what the agent wants to do, approve or reject each change, and maintain a complete audit trail.

**Option A -- Binary download (macOS / Linux)**

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -LO https://github.com/trustedautonomy/ta/releases/latest/download/ta-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
tar xzf ta-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
sudo mv ta /usr/local/bin/

# macOS (Intel)
curl -LO https://github.com/trustedautonomy/ta/releases/latest/download/ta-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
tar xzf ta-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
sudo mv ta /usr/local/bin/

# Linux (x86_64)
curl -LO https://github.com/trustedautonomy/ta/releases/latest/download/ta-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
tar xzf ta-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
sudo mv ta /usr/local/bin/
```

**Option B -- Cargo install**

```bash
cargo install ta-cli
```

**Option C -- Build from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trustedautonomy/ta.git
cd ta
./dev cargo build --workspace --release
# Binary is at target/release/ta
```

### Your first goal in three commands

```bash
# 1. Run a goal -- TA copies your project to an isolated workspace,
#    launches the agent, and captures all changes as a draft.
ta run "Add a README badge for build status" --source .

# 2. Review the draft -- see what changed and why.
ta draft view <draft-id>

# 3. Approve and apply -- changes land in your working directory.
ta draft approve <draft-id>
ta draft apply <draft-id>
```

### What just happened

1. **Staging**: TA copied your project into an isolated virtual workspace (`.ta/staging/`). The agent worked there, not in your real files.
2. **Draft**: When the agent finished, TA diffed the workspace against your source and packaged the changes into a draft.
3. **Review**: You reviewed the draft -- every changed file with a summary of what changed and why.
4. **Apply**: After approval, TA copied the approved changes back into your project.

The agent never touched your real files. If you reject the draft, nothing changes.

---

## Core Concepts

### The Staging Model

TA creates an isolated copy of your project (the *virtual workspace*) for every goal. The agent works inside this copy using its native tools. TA is invisible to the agent -- it does not know TA exists. When the agent finishes, TA diffs the workspace against the original and packages the differences into a reviewable draft.

This means:
- Your source files are never modified until you explicitly apply a draft.
- Multiple goals can run concurrently without interfering with each other.
- If something goes wrong, you reject the draft and start over.

### Goals

A goal is a unit of work. It has a lifecycle:

```
Created --> Running --> DraftReady --> UnderReview --> Approved --> Applied --> Completed
```

You create a goal with `ta run`. The agent works on it. TA builds a draft. You review, approve, and apply. Each transition is recorded in the audit log.

Goals can link to plan phases (`--phase`), follow up on previous goals (`--follow-up`), or decompose into sub-goals (`--macro`).

### Drafts

A draft is the package of changes an agent produced, waiting for your review. It contains:
- **Artifacts** -- individual changed files with before/after diffs
- **Summaries** -- per-file descriptions of what changed and why
- **Dependencies** -- which files depend on each other
- **Decision log** -- the agent's reasoning and alternatives considered

Draft lifecycle:

```bash
ta draft list                   # See all drafts
ta draft view <id>              # Review a specific draft
ta draft approve <id>           # Mark as approved
ta draft apply <id>             # Copy approved changes to your project
ta draft close <id>             # Abandon without applying
```

For simple workflows, `ta draft apply` works directly on unapproved drafts (auto-approves on apply).

### Agents

TA wraps any agent framework. Out of the box it supports:
- **Claude Code** (default) -- Anthropic's coding agent
- **Codex** -- OpenAI's coding agent
- **Claude Flow** -- multi-agent orchestration

Use `--agent` to select:

```bash
ta run "Fix the bug" --source . --agent codex
```

You can add any agent by creating a YAML config file (see [Agent Configuration](#agent-configuration)).

---

## Common Workflows

### Single Task

The most basic workflow: one goal, one review, one apply.

```bash
ta run "Refactor the auth module" --source .
# Wait for agent to finish...

ta draft view <draft-id>
ta draft approve <draft-id>
ta draft apply <draft-id>
```

To apply with a git commit in one step:

```bash
ta draft apply <draft-id> --git-commit
```

### Follow-Up Iterations

Fix issues discovered during review without losing context:

```bash
# Start a follow-up (inherits context from the most recent goal)
ta run "Fix clippy warnings from review" --source . --follow-up

# With a specific parent goal
ta run "Address review feedback" --source . --follow-up <goal-id-prefix>

# With detailed instructions
ta run --source . --follow-up --objective "Fix the discuss items on config.toml -- add env var override support"

# From a file
ta run --source . --follow-up --objective-file review-notes.md
```

When the parent goal's staging directory still exists, TA prompts to reuse it. Choosing yes (the default) means work accumulates into a single unified draft.

```toml
# .ta/workflow.toml -- follow-up behavior
[follow_up]
default_mode = "extend"       # "extend" (reuse staging) or "standalone" (fresh copy)
auto_supersede = true          # auto-supersede parent draft when extending
```

### Macro Goals (Inner-Loop Iteration)

For complex tasks, let the agent stay in a single session and submit multiple drafts:

```bash
ta run "Build the v0.5 features" --source . --macro
```

The agent receives MCP tools (`ta_draft`, `ta_goal_inner`, `ta_plan`) and can:
1. Work on a logical unit of change
2. Build and submit a draft for review
3. Wait for your approval or feedback
4. Continue working based on your response

You review inline as the agent works:

```
  Draft Ready for Review: abc123
  Files: src/auth/mod.rs, src/auth/jwt.rs
  Summary: Extract JWT validation into dedicated module

  [a]pprove  [r]eject  [d]iscuss  [v]iew diff
> a
  Approved. Agent continuing...
```

Use `d` to give feedback:

```
> d please use the existing AuthError type from src/error.rs
```

The agent receives your feedback and revises. Every sub-goal draft goes through the same human review gate.

### Interactive Sessions

Run an interactive session with PTY capture and session lifecycle:

```bash
ta run "Implement feature X" --source . --interactive
```

In interactive mode:
- Agent output streams to your terminal in real-time
- You can type guidance mid-session
- Sessions support pause/resume

```bash
# Resume a paused session
ta run --resume <session-id>

# Or via the session subcommand
ta session resume <session-id>

# List sessions
ta session list

# View session details and history
ta session show <session-id>
```

Combine with `--macro` for interactive inner-loop iteration:

```bash
ta run "Refactor auth" --source . --macro --interactive
```

### Plan-Linked Goals

Link goals to `PLAN.md` phases for automatic tracking:

```bash
ta run "Complete Phase v0.4.5" --source . --phase v0.4.5

# When applied, PLAN.md is auto-updated to mark the phase done
```

Plan commands:

```bash
ta plan list                         # List all phases with status
ta plan status                       # Progress summary
ta plan next                         # Next pending phase with suggested command
ta plan validate v0.3.1              # Phase details, linked goals, draft summaries
ta plan history                      # Status transition history
ta plan init                         # Extract plan-schema.yaml from existing plan
ta plan create                       # Generate new plan from template
ta plan create --template feature    # Feature template
```

### Review Sessions

For thorough multi-step reviews with per-artifact comments:

```bash
# Start a review session
ta draft review start <draft-id>

# Comment on specific files
ta draft review comment "src/auth.rs" "Wrong approach -- use JWT not sessions"

# Set dispositions
ta draft review approve "src/lib.rs"
ta draft review reject "config.toml" --reason "Needs env var override"
ta draft review discuss "src/auth.rs" --comment "Questions about this approach"

# Navigate through unreviewed artifacts
ta draft review next

# Add session-level notes
ta draft review note "Overall well-structured, auth needs rework"

# Finish and apply
ta draft review finish --approve "src/**" --reject "config.toml"
```

### Correcting a Draft

Three paths depending on the size of the fix:

**Direct amendment** -- for typos and small fixes you can make yourself:

```bash
ta draft amend <draft-id> src/main.rs --file corrected_main.rs
ta draft amend <draft-id> config.toml --drop
ta draft amend <draft-id> src/lib.rs --file fixed.rs --reason "Fixed typo in function name"
```

**Scoped agent fix** -- for logic changes that need agent help:

```bash
ta draft fix <draft-id> --guidance "Remove duplicate struct, reuse AlternativeConsidered"
ta draft fix <draft-id> src/draft.rs --guidance "Consolidate the duplicate"
```

**Full re-work** -- for architectural changes:

```bash
ta run "Rework auth to use JWT per review feedback" --source . --follow-up
```

### Draft Lifecycle Hygiene

```bash
# Close without applying (abandoned, hand-merged, obsolete)
ta draft close <draft-id>
ta draft close <draft-id> --reason "Hand-merged upstream"

# Find forgotten drafts
ta draft list --stale

# Clean up staging directories for old drafts
ta draft gc --dry-run       # Preview
ta draft gc                 # Remove
ta draft gc --archive       # Archive instead of delete
```

Configure thresholds:

```toml
# .ta/workflow.toml
[gc]
stale_threshold_days = 7
health_check = true          # One-line warning on startup if stale drafts exist
```

---

## Configuration

### Workflow Config (`.ta/workflow.toml`)

The central configuration file for TA behavior:

```toml
[submit]
adapter = "git"                    # "git" or "none"
auto_commit = true                 # Commit on ta draft apply
auto_push = true                   # Push after commit
auto_review = true                 # Open GitHub PR after push

[submit.git]
branch_prefix = "ta/"              # Branch naming: ta/goal-title
target_branch = "main"             # GitHub PR base branch
merge_strategy = "squash"          # squash | merge | rebase
pr_template = ".ta/pr-template.md" # GitHub PR body template

[follow_up]
default_mode = "extend"            # extend | standalone
auto_supersede = true
rebase_on_apply = true

[build]
summary_enforcement = "warning"    # ignore | warning | error

[gc]
stale_threshold_days = 7
health_check = true
```

Without this file, TA uses sensible defaults (no VCS operations, warning-level enforcement).

### Agent Configuration

TA searches for agent configs in priority order:
1. `.ta/agents/<agent>.yaml` -- project-specific
2. `~/.config/ta/agents/<agent>.yaml` -- user-wide
3. Built-in defaults (shipped with the binary)
4. Hard-coded fallback

Create a custom agent config:

```yaml
# .ta/agents/my-agent.yaml
name: my-agent
description: "My custom coding agent"
command: my-agent-cli
args_template:
  - "--mode"
  - "autonomous"
  - "{prompt}"
injects_context_file: false
injects_settings: false
env:
  MY_AGENT_LOG_LEVEL: "info"
interactive:
  enabled: true
  output_capture: pty
  allow_human_input: true
  auto_exit_on: "idle_timeout: 300s"
  resume_cmd: "my-agent-cli --resume {session_id}"
```

Config fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `command` | string | Command to execute (must be on PATH) |
| `args_template` | string[] | Arguments; `{prompt}` replaced with goal text |
| `injects_context_file` | bool | Inject goal context into CLAUDE.md |
| `injects_settings` | bool | Inject `.claude/settings.local.json` with permissions |
| `pre_launch` | object | Command to run before agent launch |
| `env` | map | Environment variables for the agent process |
| `interactive` | object | Interactive session config (PTY capture, resume) |
| `alignment` | object | Alignment profile (see below) |

### Alignment Profiles

Alignment profiles declare what an agent can do, must escalate, and must never touch. TA compiles these into enforceable capability grants -- the agent cannot exceed them.

```yaml
# .ta/agents/claude-code.yaml
alignment:
  principal: "project-owner"
  autonomy_envelope:
    bounded_actions:
      - "fs_read"
      - "fs_write_patch"
      - "fs_apply"
      - "exec: cargo test"
      - "exec: cargo build"
    escalation_triggers:
      - "new_dependency"
      - "security_sensitive"
      - "breaking_change"
    forbidden_actions:
      - "network_external"
      - "credential_access"
  constitution: "default-v1"
  coordination:
    allowed_collaborators: ["codex", "claude-flow"]
    shared_resources: ["src/**", "tests/**"]
```

Common profiles:

| Profile | bounded_actions | forbidden_actions |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Read-only auditor | `fs_read` | `fs_write_patch`, `fs_apply`, `network_external`, `credential_access` |
| Full developer (default) | `fs_read`, `fs_write_patch`, `fs_apply`, `exec: cargo test`, `exec: cargo build` | `network_external`, `credential_access` |

### Access Constitutions

Per-goal declarations of what URIs the agent should need. Deviations trigger warnings:

```bash
# Set a constitution for a goal
ta goal constitution set <goal-id> \
  --access "src/commands/draft.rs:Add constitution enforcement" \
  --access "crates/ta-policy/src/**:Constitution data model" \
  --enforcement warning

# Propose one based on historical patterns
ta goal constitution propose <goal-id>

# View or list
ta goal constitution view <goal-id>
ta goal constitution list
```

Constitution files live at `.ta/constitutions/goal-<id>.yaml`.

### Configurable Summary Exemption

`ta draft build` checks that every changed file has a summary. Some files (lockfiles, config manifests) do not need hand-written summaries. Customize with `.ta/summary-exempt`:

```
# .ta/summary-exempt (.gitignore-style patterns)
Cargo.lock
package-lock.json
Cargo.toml
package.json
**/*.generated.*
```

Without this file, TA uses built-in defaults. See `examples/summary-exempt`.

### Plan Schema (`.ta/plan-schema.yaml`)

Customize how TA parses your plan document:

```yaml
source: PLAN.md
phase_patterns:
  - regex: "^##+ (?:v?[\\d.]+[a-z]? -- |Phase \\d+ -- )(.+)"
    id_capture: "version_or_phase_number"
status_marker: "<!-- status: (\\w+) -->"
statuses: [done, in_progress, pending]
```

Generate automatically with `ta plan init`.

---

## Advanced Features

### Selective Approval

Approve, reject, or discuss individual files using glob patterns:

```bash
ta draft apply <draft-id> \
  --approve "src/**" \
  --reject "config.toml" \
  --discuss "README.md"

# Special values
ta draft apply <draft-id> --approve "all"
ta draft apply <draft-id> --approve "src/**" --reject "rest"
```

TA validates dependencies: if you approve file A that depends on rejected file B, you get a warning.

### Behavioral Drift Detection

Monitor agents for behavior that diverges from their historical patterns:

```bash
# Compute and store a baseline
ta audit baseline <agent-id>

# Check for drift
ta audit drift <agent-id>

# Drift summary across all agents
ta audit drift --all
```

Five drift signals are tracked:
- Resource scope drift (accessing unusual URIs)
- Escalation frequency change
- Rejection rate drift
- Change volume anomaly
- Dependency pattern shift

Baselines are stored in `.ta/baselines/<agent-id>.json`.

### Conflict Detection

If source files change while a goal is running:

```bash
ta draft apply <draft-id>
# WARNING: 3 conflict(s) detected

# Resolution strategies:
ta draft apply <draft-id> --conflict-resolution abort           # Default
ta draft apply <draft-id> --conflict-resolution force-overwrite # Dangerous
ta draft apply <draft-id> --conflict-resolution merge           # Git adapter
```

### External Diff Handlers

Configure how non-text files are reviewed. Create `.ta/diff-handlers.toml`:

```toml
[[handler]]
pattern = "*.png"
command = "open"
args = ["-a", "Preview", "{file}"]
description = "PNG image"

[[handler]]
pattern = "Content/**/*.uasset"
command = "UnrealEditor"
args = ["{file}"]
description = "Unreal asset"

[[handler]]
pattern = "models/**/*.blend"
command = "blender"
args = ["--background", "{file}", "--python", "scripts/preview.py"]
description = "Blender scene"
```

When you run `ta draft view <id> --file image.png`, it opens in the configured handler. Use `--no-open-external` to force inline display.

### Git Integration

```bash
# Apply and commit
ta draft apply <draft-id> --git-commit

# Full workflow: apply, commit, push, open GitHub PR
ta draft apply <draft-id> --submit
```

Configure in `.ta/workflow.toml`:

```toml
[submit]
adapter = "git"
auto_commit = true
auto_push = true

[submit.git]
branch_prefix = "ta/"
target_branch = "main"
```

### Release Pipeline

TA includes a YAML-driven release pipeline:

```bash
# Run the built-in release pipeline
ta release run 0.4.0-alpha

# Preview without executing
ta release run 0.4.0-alpha --dry-run

# Show pipeline steps
ta release show

# Create a customizable .ta/release.yaml
ta release init
```

Pipeline steps can be shell commands or agent goals with optional approval gates:

```yaml
# .ta/release.yaml
steps:
  - name: Build & test
    run: |
      ./dev cargo build --workspace
      ./dev cargo test --workspace

  - name: Generate release notes
    agent:
      id: claude-code
      phase: "v0.4.0"
    objective: "Synthesize release notes for ${TAG}."
    output: .release-draft.md

  - name: Push to remote
    requires_approval: true
    run: git push origin main && git push origin ${TAG}
```

Variables available: `${VERSION}`, `${TAG}`, `${COMMITS}`, `${LAST_TAG}`.

### Versioning and Release Lifecycle

TA uses [semver](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-prerelease`.

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **alpha** | Active development. APIs may change. Not for production. |
| **beta** | Feature-complete for the cycle. APIs stabilizing. |
| **rc.N** | Release candidate. Bug fixes only. |
| *(none)* | Stable release. Semver guarantees apply. |

Plan phases map to release versions:

| Plan Phase | Release Version |
|------------|----------------|
| v0.4 | `0.4.0-alpha` |
| v0.4.1 | `0.4.1-alpha` |
| v0.4.1.2 | `0.4.1-alpha.2` |

All current releases are `alpha`. Beta begins at v0.8 (Event System). Stable `1.0.0` requires all v0.x features hardened, public API frozen, and security audit complete.

### Decision Observability

Every decision in the TA pipeline is observable:

```bash
# Decision trail for a goal
ta audit show <goal-id>

# Structured export for compliance reporting
ta audit export <goal-id> --format json

# Verify audit log integrity (hash chain)
ta audit verify

# Recent events
ta audit tail -n 20
```

Policy decisions capture which grants were checked and why. Agent decisions can include alternatives considered. Review decisions support structured reasoning with rationale.

### Audit Trail

TA maintains an append-only, SHA-256 hash-chained audit log of every action:
- Goal creation, state transitions
- Draft builds, approvals, rejections, amendments
- Policy evaluations with grant-level detail
- Human review decisions with reasoning
- Conflict detection and resolution

### Claude Flow Optimization

When using Claude Flow as your agent:

```json
{
  "claudeFlow": {
    "modelPreferences": {
      "default": "claude-opus-4-6",
      "routing": "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"
    },
    "swarm": {
      "topology": "hierarchical-mesh",
      "maxAgents": 15
    },
    "memory": {
      "backend": "hybrid",
      "enableHNSW": true
    }
  }
}
```

See `examples/claude-settings.json` for a complete optimized configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent cannot access files

**Cause**: Exclude patterns (`.taignore`) blocking access.

**Fix**: Check your exclude patterns:
```bash
cat .taignore
```

The default excludes `target/`, `node_modules/`, `.git/`, and similar build artifacts. Add or remove patterns as needed.

### External handler does not open

**Cause**: Command not found or misconfigured path.

**Fix**:
```bash
# Test the command directly
blender /path/to/file.blend

# Fallback to inline diff
ta draft view <draft-id> --file test.blend --no-open-external
```

### Selective approval fails with dependency errors

**Cause**: An approved file depends on a rejected file.

**Fix**: View dependencies and approve coupled changes together:
```bash
ta draft view <draft-id>
ta draft apply <draft-id> --approve "src/main.rs" --approve "src/lib.rs"
```

### Conflicts on apply

**Cause**: Source files changed since the goal started.

**Fix**:
```bash
# Start a fresh goal (safest)
ta draft apply <draft-id> --conflict-resolution abort
ta run "Redo the task" --source .

# Force overwrite (use with caution)
ta draft apply <draft-id> --conflict-resolution force-overwrite

# Git merge (if git adapter configured)
ta draft apply <draft-id> --conflict-resolution merge
```

### Agent does not pause for review in macro mode

**Cause**: Missing `--macro` flag. Without it, the agent has no MCP tools and exits after one pass.

### Session shows "Aborted"

**Cause**: Agent process crashed or was killed.

**Fix**: Check the session log:
```bash
ta session show <session-id>
