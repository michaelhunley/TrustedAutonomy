# TA Constitution

> The canonical behavioral contract for Trusted Autonomy.
> Every command, subsystem, and integration must adhere to these rules.
> Pre-release reviews validate conformance against this document.

**Last updated**: v0.10.18-alpha
**Status**: Living document — update when behavior changes.

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Agent Invisibility
TA is invisible to the agent. The agent works in a staging copy using native tools (editor, compiler, test runner). It sees a normal project — not a sandboxed environment. TA mediates through injection (CLAUDE.md, settings) and observation (diffs), never by intercepting agent commands.

### 1.2 Default-Deny
All agent actions are denied unless explicitly granted. The policy engine evaluates every request against a capability manifest. No manifest = no access. Expired manifest = no access. Unknown verb = deny.

### 1.3 Human-in-the-Loop
Irreversible side effects always require human approval. The verbs `apply`, `commit`, `send`, and `post` are hardcoded as approval-required regardless of grants. The agent may propose; only the human (or a constitutional auto-approval policy) may execute.

### 1.4 Observable & Actionable
Every outcome must be observable (logged with details) and actionable (user knows what to do next). No silent failures. No bare "Error" messages. Every error path includes: what happened, what was being attempted, and what the user can do about it.

### 1.5 Append-Only Audit
All significant actions are recorded in an append-only, hash-chained audit log. Each event links to the previous via `previous_hash`. The chain is verifiable via `ta audit verify`. No event may be deleted or modified after write.

---

## 2. VCS & Branch Management

### 2.1 Feature Branch Isolation
All TA-generated changes land on feature branches, never directly on the user's current branch or `main`. Branch naming convention: `ta/<sanitized-goal-title>` (truncated to 50 characters).

### 2.2 Branch Restoration Guarantee
`ta draft apply` MUST restore the user's original branch after completion, regardless of success or failure. The sequence is:
1. Save current branch via `adapter.save_state()`
2. Create feature branch, commit, push, open review
3. Restore original branch via `adapter.restore_state()`
4. Step 3 executes even if step 2 fails partially

Violation of this rule leaves the user on an unexpected branch with no indication of how to recover.

### 2.3 Submit Abstraction
VCS operations use three abstract stages, not git-specific terminology:
- **Stage**: Prepare changes for submission (git: branch + commit; p4: changelist; svn: implicit)
- **Submit**: Send to remote (git: push; p4: shelve/submit; svn: commit)
- **Review**: Request human review (git: PR; p4: review; svn: email/external)

CLI flags use `--submit`/`--no-submit` and `--review`/`--no-review`. Legacy `--git-commit`/`--git-push` are backward-compat aliases.

### 2.4 Default Submit Behavior
When a VCS adapter is configured (`[submit].adapter != "none"`), `ta draft apply` defaults to running the full submit workflow (stage + submit + review). The user must explicitly pass `--no-submit` to skip. Plain `ta draft apply <id>` does the right thing.

### 2.5 Commit Message Safety
Goal titles, draft summaries, and other user/AI-generated text MUST be sanitized before use in VCS commit messages or branch names. No shell interpolation — use direct argument passing. Special characters (backticks, single quotes, newlines) must be escaped or removed.

## 3. Staging & Overlay

### 3.1 Full Copy Model (V1)
Staging creates a complete copy of the source project in `.ta/staging/<goal-id>/`. The agent works in this copy. Diffs are computed by comparing staging to source.

### 3.2 Infrastructure Exclusion
The following directories are ALWAYS excluded from staging copies and diffs, regardless of `.taignore` configuration:
- `.ta/` — TA state and configuration
- `.claude-flow/` — Agent framework state
- `.hive-mind/` — Agent framework state
- `.swarm/` — Agent framework state

This prevents TA internal state from leaking into agent workspaces or draft artifacts.

### 3.3 Binary Detection
Files with null bytes in the first 8KB are classified as binary. Binary files appear in diffs with size summaries, not content. Both `overlay.rs` and `draft.rs` use this heuristic consistently.

### 3.4 Staging Cleanup
Staging directories for completed/applied goals should be cleaned up. `ta goal gc --include-staging` removes stale staging. Applied goals should auto-clean staging on successful apply (configurable, default: on).

---

## 4. CLAUDE.md Injection & Cleanup

### 4.1 Injection Content
`ta run` injects the following into the staging copy before launching the agent:
- `CLAUDE.md` — plan context, memory context, goal objective, interactive mode sections
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — TA-specific tool permissions
- `.mcp.json` — MCP server routing for TA tools

### 4.2 Backup Before Injection
Before modifying any file, the original content is saved as a backup. If the file did not exist, this is recorded so it can be deleted during cleanup.

### 4.3 Cleanup Guarantee
ALL injected content MUST be removed before:
- Computing diffs (`ta draft build`)
- Any early return or error exit from `ta run`
- Follow-up re-injection (restore original first, then inject fresh)

**Invariant**: No injected content appears in diffs, draft artifacts, or commits. The agent's changes are the only things captured.

### 4.4 Follow-Up Re-Injection
When a follow-up goal reuses the parent's staging, CLAUDE.md must be restored from backup before re-injecting. This prevents stale or nested injection content.

---

## 5. Goal Lifecycle

### 5.1 State Machine
Valid states and transitions:

```
Created → Configured → Running → PrReady → UnderReview → Approved → Applied → Completed

Running ↔ AwaitingInput  (interactive mode)
UnderReview → Running    (denied draft, retry)
PrReady → Running        (macro goal inner loop)
Any state → Failed       (always valid)
```

### 5.2 No State Skipping
Transitions that skip intermediate states are rejected. `Created → Running` is invalid (must go through `Configured`). The `transition()` method validates all state changes.

### 5.3 Failure Always Allowed
Any state may transition to `Failed`. This ensures crashed agents, timeouts, and user cancellations can always be recorded.

### 5.4 Goal Process Liveness
A goal in `Running` state must have a live agent process. If the process exits without updating state, the daemon should detect this and transition to `Completed` (exit 0) or `Failed` (non-zero).

### 5.5 Zombie Prevention
Goals stuck in `Running` with no live process are zombies. `ta goal gc` should detect and offer to transition them. Goals dispatched via daemon should have configurable timeouts.

---

## 6. Policy Engine

### 6.1 Evaluation Order
1. Agent has capability manifest? → No → **Deny**
2. Manifest expired? → Yes → **Deny**
3. Path traversal in resource URI? → Yes → **Deny**
4. Verb in approval-required list? → **RequireApproval** (even with matching grant)
5. Matching grant exists? → **Allow**
6. No match → **Deny**

### 6.2 Approval-Required Verbs
`apply`, `commit`, `send`, `post` — these represent irreversible side effects and ALWAYS require human approval regardless of grants.

### 6.3 Path Traversal Guard
Resource URIs containing `..` or absolute paths outside the workspace are rejected. Agents must not escape the staging directory.

### 6.4 Supervised Mode
When security level is `Supervised`, only read verbs (`read`, `list`, `diff`, `status`, `search`) are allowed without approval. All other verbs require approval.

### 6.5 Fail Closed
Invalid glob patterns in grants never match. The system fails closed (deny) rather than open (allow).

---

## 7. Audit & Compliance

### 7.1 Append-Only Writes
The audit log is opened in append mode. Writes are flushed after each event to ensure OS-level durability.

### 7.2 Hash Chain Integrity
Each `AuditEvent` includes a `previous_hash` field linking to the prior event. This forms a tamper-evident chain. `ta audit verify` validates chain integrity.

### 7.3 Tracked Actions
All of the following produce audit events:
- `ToolCall` — MCP tool invocation
- `PolicyDecision` — policy engine evaluation
- `Approval` — human approval action
- `Apply` — changes applied to target
- `Error` — error during processing
- `AutoApproval` — draft auto-approved by policy

### 7.4 Terminal Transition Auditing
Every path that ends a goal's lifecycle MUST write an audit record: apply, deny, close, delete, gc, timeout, agent crash. No goal data should be removed without a trace.

---

## 8. Drift Detection

### 8.1 Behavioral Baseline
Drift is measured against the agent's historical behavior across five signals:
- **ResourceScope** — URIs outside historical pattern
- **EscalationFrequency** — change in policy escalation rate
- **RejectionRate** — change in draft denial rate
- **ChangeVolume** — unexpectedly large/small diffs
- **DependencyPattern** — unusual external dependency additions
- **ConstitutionViolation** — undeclared access per access constitution

### 8.2 Severity Levels
- **Normal** — within historical variance
- **Warning** — notable deviation (20% rate delta, 2x volume factor)
- **Alert** — significant deviation (50% rate delta, 3x volume factor)

Constitution violations are always Warning or higher.

---

## 9. Shell & Daemon Trust Model

### 9.1 Shell as Thin Client
`ta shell` is a stateless REPL and renderer. It has no direct file access, no policy enforcement, no business logic. All authority lives in the daemon.

### 9.2 Daemon Mediates All Writes
The agent (and shell) propose actions. The daemon evaluates policy, records audit events, and mediates execution. The agent never writes directly to the source project — all changes flow through staging → diff → draft → apply.

### 9.3 Daemon Auto-Start
If `ta shell` cannot reach the daemon, it attempts auto-start via `daemon::ensure_running()`. If the daemon is still unreachable after auto-start, shell fails with a clear error.

### 9.4 Agent Read-Only Inspection
The agent can read daemon state (goal status, draft details, plan progress, logs) through MCP tools or daemon API. It cannot mutate state without daemon mediation and policy evaluation.

---

## 10. Draft Lifecycle

### 10.1 Draft States
```
Draft → PendingReview → Approved { approved_by, approved_at }
                      → Denied { reason, denied_by }

Approved → Applied { applied_at }
         → Superseded { superseded_by }

Any non-terminal → Closed
```

### 10.2 Supersession Rules
- **Same staging follow-up**: New draft auto-supersedes parent draft (same workspace, cumulative changes)
- **Different staging follow-up**: Drafts are independent — no auto-supersession
- Superseded drafts cannot be applied or re-reviewed

### 10.3 Apply Idempotence
`ta draft apply` copies artifacts from the draft package to the source project. If the source has diverged, conflict detection identifies phantom artifacts (changed in source since staging snapshot). The user must resolve conflicts before apply proceeds.

### 10.4 Draft Amend (planned)
A lightweight follow-up that works with an existing feature branch rather than creating new staging. Amends the draft with additional changes without full staging copy overhead.

---

## 11. Plugin Architecture

### 11.1 Plugin Types
- **Channel plugins**: Deliver agent questions to external systems (Discord, Slack, email). JSON-over-stdio protocol.
- **Submit plugins**: VCS adapters for non-built-in systems. Named `ta-submit-<name>`.
- **Data write plugins**: Audit storage backends (database, cloud storage).

### 11.2 Plugin Discovery
Plugins are executables in `~/.ta/plugins/` or project-local `.ta/plugins/`. Named by convention: `ta-<type>-<name>`.

### 11.3 Plugin Isolation
Plugins run as separate processes. They communicate via stdio (channel plugins) or CLI protocol (submit plugins). A misbehaving plugin cannot corrupt TA state.

### 11.4 macOS Code Signing
On macOS, plugin binaries must be re-signed with `codesign --force --sign -` after copying to prevent AppleSystemPolicy from blocking execution.

---

## 12. Build & Test Environment

### 12.1 Nix Toolchain
All cargo commands run inside the Nix devShell. Use `./dev "command"` or `nix develop --command bash -c "command"`.

### 12.2 Pre-Commit Verification
Four checks must pass before every commit:
1. `cargo build --workspace`
2. `cargo test --workspace`
3. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
4. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`

### 12.3 Test Fixtures
All tests requiring filesystem access use `tempfile::tempdir()`. No hardcoded paths. No test pollution across runs.

### 12.4 Platform Parity
Tests must pass on macOS, Linux, and Windows CI. Platform-specific tests use `#[cfg(unix)]` / `#[cfg(windows)]` with appropriate implementations for each.

---

## 13. Error Handling

### 13.1 Structured Errors
Error messages include:
- **What happened**: The specific failure
- **What was being attempted**: The operation context
- **What to do**: Next steps for the user

### 13.2 Timeout Reporting
Timeout errors state: which operation, the timeout duration, and how to configure it.

### 13.3 CLI Confirmation
Commands confirm what they did, not just succeed silently. Include counts, paths, IDs, and durations where relevant.

### 13.4 Logging
Use `tracing::warn`/`tracing::error` for operational issues. Include structured fields (command, duration, path), not just string messages.
