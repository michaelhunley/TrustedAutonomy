# ADR: Product Concept Model — TA as a Governance Platform

> **Status**: Accepted
> **Author**: Claude (v0.5.7 session)
> **Supersedes**: Complements ADR-modular-decomposition (crate extraction); this ADR defines the product layer model and extension points
> **Context**: Untangling TA's concerns into a clear product model that supports building projects on top (Virtual Office, Autonomous Infra Ops, etc.)

---

## The Thesis

TA is a **governance infrastructure platform** — a base layer that other projects build on. It sits between AI agents and the resources they act on, enforcing that humans retain meaningful control.

**Core invariant: agents propose, humans dispose.**

TA is not an agent framework. It is not an orchestrator. It is the mediation substrate that makes any agent framework safe to use autonomously.

---

## The Five Layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Projects on top: Virtual Office, Infra Ops, others     │
│  (generate workflows + agent guidance + security plans) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L5  IO & Delivery     CLI · Web · Slack · Discord      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L4  Agent Integration  MCP gateway · Memory · Creds    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L3  Session & Review   Human control plane · Drafts    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L2  Supervision        Policy engine · Drift · Audit   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L1  Resource Mediation Staging for files, APIs, email  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer has a single responsibility, clear boundaries, and defined extension points.

---

### Layer 1 — Resource Mediation

**"The staging pattern, generalized to anything."**

Every state-changing action an agent proposes is staged before it touches the real world. For files, this is the existing staging workspace. For emails, it's a draft in the queue. For database operations, it's a recorded statement. For API calls, it's a serialized request.

**Key trait:**

```rust
trait ResourceMediator: Send + Sync {
    fn scheme(&self) -> &str;           // "fs", "email", "db", "api"
    fn stage(&self, action: ProposedAction) -> Result<StagedMutation>;
    fn preview(&self, staged: &StagedMutation) -> Result<MutationPreview>;
    fn apply(&self, staged: &StagedMutation) -> Result<ApplyResult>;
    fn rollback(&self, staged: &StagedMutation) -> Result<()>;
    fn classify(&self, action: &ProposedAction) -> ActionClassification;
}
```

**URI schemes are categories, not products.** `email://` is the scheme; Gmail, Outlook, Fastmail are provider variants configured via credentials. Same pattern: `db://` with Postgres/MySQL/SQLite variants, `cloud://` with AWS/GCP/Azure variants.

| Scheme | Provider examples | Staging mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `fs://` | local filesystem | Copy to staging directory |
| `email://` | Gmail, Outlook, Fastmail | Create draft via provider API |
| `db://` | Postgres, MySQL, SQLite | Record SQL in transaction log |
| `api://` | Any MCP tool call | Serialize request + parameters |
| `social://` | Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Bluesky | Create draft post |
| `cloud://` | AWS, GCP, Azure | Record IaC change / API call |

**Core vs. extension:**
- Core: `ResourceMediator` trait, `FsMediator` (wraps existing `FsConnector` + `StagingWorkspace`)
- Extension: `EmailMediator`, `DbMediator`, `ApiMediator` — each a separate crate with provider-specific adapters

**Configuration** (`.ta/config.yaml`):
```yaml
mediators:
  fs:
    enabled: true              # always on
  email:
    enabled: true
    provider: gmail            # provider variant
    credential: "gmail-oauth"  # references CredentialVault entry
  db:
    enabled: false             # opt-in
    provider: postgres
    credential: "pg-prod"
```

**Opt-in scope:** File mediation is always on. Other mediators are enabled explicitly by the human, not the agent. You would NOT mediate a resource when: (a) it's read-only, (b) it's in a sandbox with no real-world effect, or (c) the cost of review exceeds the cost of the mistake.

**Output types** feed into existing `DraftPackage.changes` — Artifacts for files, PatchSets for external resources, PendingActions for API calls.

**Crate:** New `ta-mediation` (trait + shared types). Existing `ta-connectors/fs` evolves to implement `ResourceMediator`.

---

### Layer 2 — Supervision & Policy

**"Default-deny, configurable via YAML."**

Every proposed action is evaluated against policy before staging. The policy engine is default-deny — no manifest means denied.

#### Policy cascade: layers that stack

Policies compose through a layered cascade. Each layer can tighten but never loosen the layer above it:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Built-in defaults (hardcoded)           │  Path traversal always denied.
│     Cannot be overridden.                   │  Approval-required verbs enforced.
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. Project policy (.ta/policy.yaml)        │  Global rules for this project.
│     Sets the baseline for all agents/goals. │  Schemes, escalation, security level.
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. Workflow policy (.ta/workflows/*.yaml)  │  Per-workflow overrides.
│     E.g., "code-review" vs. "email-triage"  │  Can restrict, cannot expand.
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  4. Agent profile (agents/<name>.yaml)      │  Per-agent capabilities.
│     E.g., claude-code vs. codex             │  Bounded actions, forbidden actions.
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  5. Goal constitution (.ta/constitutions/)  │  Per-goal scope.
│     E.g., "this goal can only touch src/"   │  Narrowest scope wins.
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  6. CLI overrides (flags)                   │  Session-level tweaks.
│     E.g., --auto-approve, --strict          │  Temporary, not persisted.
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Resolution rule:** At each layer, rules can only add restrictions or escalation triggers — never remove them. If the project policy says `email: { approval_required: [send] }`, a workflow policy cannot set `email: { approval_required: [] }`. It can add `email: { approval_required: [send, delete] }`.

**Project policy** (`.ta/policy.yaml`):
```yaml
version: "1"

defaults:
  enforcement: warning          # warning | error | strict
  auto_approve:
    read_only: true             # reads pass without review
    internal_tools: true        # ta_* tools pass without review

schemes:
  fs:
    approval_required: [apply, delete]
  email:
    approval_required: [send, delete]
    credential_required: true
  db:
    approval_required: ["*"]    # everything requires approval

escalation:
  - new_dependency
  - security_sensitive
  - breaking_change
  - budget_exceeded
  - external_communication
```

**Workflow policy** (`.ta/workflows/code-review.yaml`):
```yaml
extends: .ta/policy.yaml         # inherits project defaults
schemes:
  fs:
    file_patterns: ["src/**", "tests/**"]   # restrict to source files only
    approval_required: [apply, delete]
auto_approve:
  supervisor: true                # enable constitutional auto-approval
  risk_score_max: 20
```

**Goal constitution** (`.ta/constitutions/goal-<id>.yaml`):
```yaml
# Narrowest scope — this specific goal can only touch these URIs
allowed_uris:
  - "fs://workspace/src/auth/**"
  - "fs://workspace/tests/auth/**"
enforcement: error                # violations block the draft
```

**Runtime-aware decisions** via `PolicyContext`:
```rust
struct PolicyContext {
    goal_id: Option<Uuid>,
    session_id: Option<Uuid>,
    budget_spent: Option<f64>,
    action_count: usize,
    drift_score: Option<f64>,
}
```

This enables rules like "allow file writes, but escalate after 50 writes" or "allow email sends, but escalate if budget exceeds $5."

**Security levels (opt-in):**

| Level | Behavior | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| Open | Auto-approve all, audit-only | Sandboxed experiments, trusted agents |
| Checkpoint (default) | Agent runs freely, human reviews at draft | Normal development |
| Supervised | Every state-changing action needs approval | Production, external comms |
| Strict | Everything logged, constitutions required | Regulated environments |

**Extension point — policy generation:** TA evaluates any YAML you give it. External tools (including the paid Policy Studio — see `docs/paid-addons/policy-studio.md`) can generate and validate policy YAML. Virtual Office and Infra Ops generate `AlignmentProfile` and `AccessConstitution` YAML that TA consumes. Projects own "smart security plan" generation; TA owns enforcement.

**Crate:** `ta-policy` gains `PolicyDocument` loading. `ta-audit` unchanged.

---

### Layer 3 — Session & Review

**"The human control plane."**

This is the most significant reframing. Layer 3 is not just "review drafts" — it is the **ongoing interactive session between the human and TA** that the agent framework does not see or control.

#### The TA Session

A TA session is the human's view of work in progress. It:

- **Starts** when the human begins work (`ta run` or equivalent from any IO channel)
- **Spans** one or more agent framework invocations (goal stacking)
- **Provides** a command surface the agent cannot access (safety boundary)
- **Streams** events in real-time across all IO channels
- **Supports** fluid review — approve/reject/guide without blocking the agent
- **Ends** when the human decides, not when the agent exits

#### Human control plane commands

These go through TA's own endpoint. The agent framework connects to a *different* endpoint (the gateway). **The agent never sees session commands.**

```
ta session status          # what's the agent doing right now?
ta session guide "..."     # inject guidance (agent sees it as context)
ta session pause/resume    # pause agent execution
ta session switch <agent>  # swap to different agent framework mid-session
ta session stack <goal>    # stack a new goal onto the current session
ta draft approve/reject    # review decisions
ta audit trail             # what happened so far
```

#### Fluid sessions as the default

- **Default mode**: ongoing interactive session. Agent works continuously, human reviews in real-time, injects guidance anytime. Draft submission is a summary checkpoint, not a blocking gate.
- **Checkpoint mode**: opt-in for batch/CI workflows where the human isn't watching.

#### Goal stacking

The human can queue goals while the agent works. When the current goal completes (or is paused), the next starts. Goals can use different agent frameworks.

#### Agent framework intermingling

A single TA session can run simultaneously:
1. Claude Code for implementation
2. Codex for parallel test generation
3. Claude Flow for multi-agent coordination

All share the same memory, credentials, and policy. TA mediates them all equally.

#### Key types

```rust
struct TaSession {
    session_id: Uuid,
    active_goals: Vec<GoalRun>,         // goal stack
    active_agents: Vec<AgentConnection>, // multiple frameworks simultaneously
    pending_reviews: Vec<PendingReviewItem>,
    event_stream: broadcast::Sender<SessionEvent>,
}

enum SessionEvent {
    FileChanged { path: String, diff_preview: String },
    ActionIntercepted { action: PendingAction },
    DraftReady { draft_id: Uuid, summary: String },
    AgentOutput { agent_id: String, content: String },
    AgentWaiting { agent_id: String, prompt: String },
    GoalCompleted { goal_id: Uuid, status: GoalRunState },
    ReviewDecision { target: String, disposition: ArtifactDisposition },
}
```

**Crate:** New `ta-session` (session lifecycle, event streaming, goal stacking). `ta-changeset` keeps `DraftPackage`, `ReviewChannel`, interaction types.

---

### Layer 4 — Agent Integration

**"TA connects to any framework without coupling to any."**

TA provides MCP tools, credential brokering, memory, and context injection. It does NOT orchestrate agents — that's the framework's job.

**What TA provides (the Agent Contract):**
- Tool manifest (available MCP tools)
- Access scope (from policy + constitution)
- Memory context (relevant entries for this goal)
- Session protocol (how to submit drafts, handle review)
- Credential tokens (scoped, time-bounded)

**How the contract is delivered:**
- Claude Code: CLAUDE.md injection (markdown)
- Codex: system prompt or context file
- Generic MCP clients: `ta_session_info` tool response

**What is NOT TA's job:**
- Agent selection ("which agent for this task?")
- Goal decomposition ("break this into sub-tasks")
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Tool implementation (TA intercepts calls, doesn't implement `email_send`)

**Extension points for projects on top:**
- Virtual Office generates agent guidance + workflow definitions → TA consumes as `AlignmentProfile` + `AgentLaunchConfig`
- Infra Ops generates IaC plans → TA mediates the infrastructure changes
- Projects provide their own agent selection; TA enforces policy on whatever they choose

**Crates:** `ta-mcp-gateway`, `ta-credentials`, `ta-memory` — all unchanged.

---

### Layer 5 — IO & Delivery

**"Route TA to wherever the human is."**

All IO channels are equal. CLI, web UI, Slack, Discord, email — pluggable implementations of the same traits. No channel is special.

**Channel routing** (`.ta/config.yaml`):
```yaml
channels:
  review:
    type: slack
    channel: "#reviews"
  notify:
    - type: terminal
    - type: slack
      level: warning
  session:
    type: terminal
    fallback: web
  escalation:
    type: email
    to: "manager@company.com"
```

**Channels can set defaults for agent frameworks:**
```yaml
channels:
  review:
    type: slack
    channel: "#engineering"
    default_agent: claude-code
    default_workflow: standard-dev
```

**Key abstraction:**
```rust
trait ChannelFactory: Send + Sync {
    fn build_review(&self, config: &Value) -> Result<Box<dyn ReviewChannel>>;
    fn build_session(&self, config: &Value) -> Result<Box<dyn SessionChannel>>;
    fn capabilities(&self) -> ChannelCapabilities;
}

struct ChannelRegistry {
    factories: HashMap<String, Box<dyn ChannelFactory>>,
}
```

**Core:** `ReviewChannel`, `SessionChannel`, `ChannelRegistry`, `TerminalChannel`, web UI.
**Plugin:** `ta-channel-slack`, `ta-channel-discord`, `ta-channel-email` — separate crates.

## Data Flow (complete request)

```
Agent calls email_send via MCP
  → L4 (Agent Integration): MCP gateway receives the tool call
  → L2 (Supervision): PolicyEngine evaluates — check email:// grants, budget, drift
  → L1 (Resource Mediation): EmailMediator.stage() → creates provider draft (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
  → L3 (Session & Review): StagedMutation added to DraftPackage
  → L5 (IO): Slack notification — "Agent wants to send email to X, approve?"
  → Human approves via Slack
  → L1 (Resource Mediation): EmailMediator.apply() → sends via provider
  → L2 (Supervision): AuditLog records outcome
```

## Paid Add-Ons

Paid add-ons are convenience and enterprise features — they never gate core functionality. A solo developer can use TA fully with hand-written YAML and the terminal.

**Boundary:** Open-source core has all traits, the default-deny engine, file mediation, terminal/web UI, and the audit trail. Paid add-ons provide better tooling, enterprise integrations, and compliance packaging.

See `docs/paid-addons/` for detailed specifications:
- `docs/paid-addons/policy-studio.md` — Interactive policy generation and compliance mapping
- `docs/paid-addons/enterprise-channels.md` — Teams, ServiceNow, PagerDuty channel implementations
- `docs/paid-addons/advanced-mediators.md` — Production DB and cloud API mediators
- `docs/paid-addons/compliance-reporting.md` — Audit report generation for regulatory frameworks

---

## Decision Record

1. **ResourceMediator is the L1 abstraction gap.** The file staging pattern works; it needs generalizing to arbitrary URI schemes. The data model (`PatchSet`, `PendingAction`) already anticipates this.

2. **Policy configuration unifies in `.ta/policy.yaml`.** The engine stays the same; the input becomes a merged PolicyDocument.

3. **The human control plane (L3) is TA's most distinctive feature.** Session commands that agents cannot see are the safety boundary that distinguishes TA from running agents directly.

4. **Fluid sessions are the default.** Checkpoint mode is opt-in for batch/CI. All IO channels support fluid interaction.

5. **TA does not orchestrate agents.** Agent selection, goal decomposition, and multi-agent coordination are explicitly out of scope. Projects on top do that.

6. **All IO channels are equal.** The web UI is not special — it's a channel plugin like Slack or Discord.

7. **Paid add-ons are convenience, not core functionality gating.** A solo developer can use TA fully with hand-written YAML and the terminal.
