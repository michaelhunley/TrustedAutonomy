## v0.3.6-alpha

### New Features
- **`ta draft close`** — Manually close a draft with a reason, recording a `Closed` status and audit event. Useful for abandoning drafts that are no longer needed without deleting their history.
- **`ta draft gc`** — Garbage-collect stale drafts that have sat unreviewed past a configurable threshold (default: 7 days). Supports `--dry-run` to preview what would be collected and `--archive` to preserve copies before removal.
- **`ta draft list --stale`** — Filter the draft list to show only drafts older than the configured stale threshold, making it easy to spot forgotten work.

### Improvements
- **Auto-close parent draft on follow-up** — When a follow-up goal is applied, the original (parent) draft is automatically closed, keeping the draft list clean without manual intervention.
- **Startup health check** — Every `ta` invocation now checks for stale drafts and prints a warning if any are found, so forgotten reviews don't silently accumulate. Controlled by the `health_check` option in `[gc]` config.
- **Configurable GC settings** — New `[gc]` section in `.ta/workflow.toml` with `stale_threshold_days` and `health_check` options.
- Added release notes link to GitHub Release documentation section.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed plan status marker for v0.3.6 that hadn't been compiled in the staging workspace.
