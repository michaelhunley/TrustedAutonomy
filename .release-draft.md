## v0.3.4-alpha

### New Features

- **Draft Amendment (`ta draft amend`)** — Correct individual artifacts in a draft without re-running the entire goal. Supports `--file` to replace an artifact's content and `--drop` to remove one entirely. Each amendment is recorded with an audit trail (who, when, how, why).
- **Targeted Re-Work (`ta draft fix`)** — Re-run the agent on a scoped subset of files within an existing draft. Lets you fix specific artifacts with a targeted agent session instead of starting over.
- **Decision Observability (`ta audit show/export`)** — Every TA pipeline decision now captures what was considered and why. New `ta audit show` and `ta audit export` commands provide a full decision trail and compliance export.
- **Reasoning Capture** — Structured reasoning metadata throughout the pipeline: `DecisionReasoning` on audit events, `EvaluationTrace` on policy evaluations, `AlternativeConsidered` on changeset entries, and `ReviewReasoning` on review comments.

### Improvements

- **WSL2 install guidance** — Added documentation for Windows users running TA under WSL2, with native Windows support planned for v0.9.1.
- **Plan phase additions** — Added v0.3.5 (Draft Lifecycle Hygiene) and v0.4.4 (Interactive Session Completion) plan phases; documented the correction workflow in PLAN.md.
- **Release pipeline reliability** — Auto-approve and apply agent drafts before proceeding to the next pipeline step; removed hard-coded version from DISCLAIMER.md.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `ta draft apply` not including PLAN.md status update in the git commit.
- Fixed `cargo fmt` failure on post-apply summary output.
- Suppressed spurious Nix dirty-tree warning during builds.
