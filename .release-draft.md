## v0.3.4-alpha

### New Features

- **Draft Amendment (`ta draft amend`)** — Correct individual artifacts in a draft without re-running the entire goal. Use `--file` to replace an artifact's content from disk, or `--drop` to remove an artifact entirely. Every amendment is recorded with a full audit trail (who, when, how, why).
- **Targeted Re-Work (`ta draft fix`)** — Re-run an agent scoped to specific files in an existing draft. The agent sees only the selected artifacts, makes corrections, and the updated content is patched back into the draft with a unified diff.
- **Decision Observability (`ta audit show`, `ta audit export`)** — Every TA pipeline decision now captures what was considered and why. New `DecisionReasoning`, `EvaluationTrace`, and `ReviewReasoning` types provide structured rationale across policy evaluation, agent alternatives, and human review.
- **Policy Evaluation Traces** — `PolicyEngine::evaluate_with_trace()` records the full grant evaluation chain so you can inspect exactly which rules fired and why.

### Improvements

- `change_summary.json` now supports `alternatives_considered` per entry, letting agents document rejected approaches alongside chosen ones.
- `ta draft build` automatically extracts decision logs from agent-reported alternatives.
- `ReviewReasoning` on review comments gives human reviewers a structured way to explain accept/reject rationale.
- Added WSL2 installation guidance for Windows users in documentation.
- Added plan phases for v0.3.5 (Draft Lifecycle Hygiene) and v0.4.4 (Interactive Session Completion).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `ta draft apply` not including PLAN.md status updates in the git commit.
- Fixed `cargo fmt` failure on post-apply summary output.
- Suppressed spurious Nix dirty-tree warnings during builds.
- Fixed release pipeline to auto-approve and apply agent drafts before proceeding to the next step.
