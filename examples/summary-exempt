# Summary exemption patterns for Trusted Autonomy.
# Files matching these patterns are exempt from summary enforcement —
# they get auto-summaries and don't need agent-provided descriptions
# at `ta draft build` time.
#
# Format: .gitignore-style glob patterns, one per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments.
# Patterns match against the filename portion of fs://workspace/ URIs.
#
# Place this file at: .ta/summary-exempt
#
# See also: [build] summary_enforcement in .ta/workflow.toml
