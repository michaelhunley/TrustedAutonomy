//! # ta-cli
//!
//! Command-line interface for Trusted Autonomy.
//!
//! Provides human review and approval workflow for agent-staged changes:
//! - `ta goal list/status` — inspect active goal runs
//! - `ta draft list/view/approve/deny/apply` — review and manage draft packages
//! - `ta audit verify/tail` — inspect the tamper-evident audit trail
//! - `ta adapter list/install` — manage agent adapter integrations
//! - `ta serve` — start MCP server on stdio
