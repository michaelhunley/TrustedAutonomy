# Trusted Autonomy

**Trusted Autonomy** is a local-first, Rust-based substrate for running autonomous AI agents **safely**, **reviewably**, and **without changing how agents behave**.

It is not an agent framework.  
It is not an orchestrator.  

It is a **trust and control plane** that sits underneath *any* agent or multi-agent system and ensures:

- agents can operate autonomously inside a defined charter
- all real-world effects are staged, reviewable, and auditable
- humans remain in control at meaningful boundaries (PR-style milestones)
- orchestration layers remain swappable and unaware of the substrate

---

## Core idea

> **Give agents everything they need to do the work — but nothing that can irreversibly affect the world without passing through a single, auditable gateway.**

Trusted Autonomy achieves this by:
- mediating *all* filesystem, network, execution, and external-service access through MCP tools
- defaulting **mutations** to *collection* (staging), not execution
- defaulting **capabilities** to deny unless explicitly granted
- representing each milestone within a goal as a **Pull Request–like package** for review

---

## What this is (and is not)

### This **is**
- a capability-gated runtime substrate
- a policy-enforced MCP gateway
- a staging and review system for agent actions
- a foundation for high-autonomy workflows with human trust

### This is **not**
- an “Agent OS VM”
- a replacement for LangGraph, Claude Flow, CrewAI, etc.
- a UI-first product
- a monolithic orchestration framework

---

## Design principles
- Normal environment illusion: tools feel like standard filesystem/network access, but all effects are mediated.
- Default collect (staged-by-default): changes accumulate as pending review artifacts (PR package) rather than applying immediately.
- Capability boundary (default deny): agents can only perform actions explicitly granted by a signed capability manifest.
- Single chokepoint: all reads/writes and external effects flow through an MCP Gateway with policy enforcement and audit.
- PR-per-milestone workflow: complex goals are decomposed into major steps, each producing a PR package for approval.
- Replaceable orchestration: the substrate is the trust layer; planners/swarms are pluggable.

## “default deny” vs “default collect”
Trusted Autonomy uses two distinct defaults:
1. Capability default (security boundary): default deny. If an agent lacks an explicit capability, the gateway rejects it.
2.  Mutation default (operational workflow): default collect. If the agent is allowed to write, the gateway routes writes into staging (patches/drafts) and queues them for review. Commit/send/post are gated.

Result: within the agent’s charter, work “just happens” and produces a PR package. Human review occurs at major milestones.

## Why MCP is the abstraction boundary

Trusted Autonomy uses **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as its sole integration surface with agents.

This is intentional.

### MCP gives us:
- a standardized tool interface
- explicit, inspectable actions
- a single chokepoint for policy, audit, and transformation
- compatibility with existing and future agent frameworks

### MCP is treated as:
> **The agent’s “operating environment”, not an API to bypass.**

Agents do not know they are operating in a staged, policy-controlled system — and they do not need to.

---

## Filesystem abstraction (why it works this way)

### Design goal
Agents should be able to **read, write, and modify files normally**, without learning a new model — while all changes remain reviewable.

### How it works
- Agents interact with filesystem tools exposed via MCP
- Those tools operate on a **staging workspace** (isolated directory per goal)
- Reads snapshot the original file; writes create diffs against the snapshot
- All writes become **ChangeSets with diffs**, bundled into PR packages

```
Agent
  ↓
MCP ta_fs_read / ta_fs_write
  ↓
StagingWorkspace (isolated temp directory)
  ↓
ChangeSet → Diff → PR Package → Human Review → Apply
```

### Why staging directories?
- cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- no kernel drivers, FUSE mounts, or Git dependency
- native diff/rollback semantics
- binary changes can be summarized and hashed
- maps cleanly to PR-style review
- each GoalRun gets complete isolation

### Why not a mounted VFS?
Kernel-level VFS (FUSE, sandboxfs, etc.) introduces:
- install friction
- permissions complexity
- platform inconsistencies

Those can be added later, but staging workspaces keep the system **portable and maintainable**.

---

## Network & web access abstraction

### Design goal
Allow agents to fetch web content **without enabling prompt injection or uncontrolled exfiltration**.

### How it works
- Agents use MCP web tools (`web.fetch`, `web.search`)
- The gateway:
  - enforces allowlists and rate limits
  - sanitizes active content
  - labels provenance and trust level
  - treats fetched content as **data, never instructions**

### Why not raw network sockets?
Raw sockets:
- bypass policy
- bypass audit
- enable hidden side effects

If needed, a transparent local proxy can be added later — but MCP tools are the correct starting point for deterministic autonomy.

---

## Email, social media, databases: everything is a ChangeSet

### Unifying principle
> **Anything that changes the world is a staged artifact.**

This includes:
- emails
- social media posts
- database writes
- API mutations
- permissions changes

### How it works
Each connector implements:
- `read`
- `write_patch` / `create_draft`
- `preview`
- `commit` (gated)

So:
- an email is drafted, not sent
- a post is created, not published
- a DB mutation is recorded, not applied

All appear in the **same PR package** alongside filesystem changes.

---

## “Default deny” vs “default collect”

Trusted Autonomy uses **two defaults**, intentionally separated:

### Capability default: **deny**
If an agent does not have an explicit capability, the gateway rejects the action.

This is the hard security boundary.

### Mutation default: **collect**
If an agent *does* have permission to write:
- the write is staged
- the change is collected
- a PR package is generated

Commit/send/post requires explicit approval or a narrowly scoped write-through capability.

This allows agents to “just work” inside their charter without risk.

---

## Execution environment (why just-bash exists)

### Design goal
Allow agents to:
- search
- format
- run tests
- scaffold code

…without giving them a real shell or OS.

### Approach
- default execution uses a **just-bash-style emulated shell**
- commands are allowlisted
- filesystem access is limited to the workspace
- transcripts are hashed and audited

For workloads requiring real runtimes, isolated containers or microVMs can be added later — still behind the same MCP gateway.

---

## Nix: why and how it’s used

### Why Nix is included
- reproducible Rust toolchains
- deterministic builds in CI
- consistent dev environments

### Why Nix is **not required** for users
- Nix has a learning curve
- some environments prohibit it
- bundling Nix into desktop apps is heavy

### Strategy
- **Use Nix for developers and CI**
- **Ship bundled binaries for end users**
- **Produce OCI images for cloud deployment**

Nix improves correctness without becoming a dependency tax.

---

## Compatibility with existing agent systems

Trusted Autonomy is designed so that:
- Claude Code
- Codex
- LangGraph
- claude-flow
- Ollama-based agents
- future orchestration layers

…can all run **unchanged** on top.

They see:
- a normal workspace
- normal tools
- normal outputs

They do **not** need to know:
- staging exists
- policies exist
- approvals exist

That separation is the core architectural property.

---

## Why PR-style milestones matter

Continuous human oversight destroys autonomy.  
Zero oversight destroys trust.

Trusted Autonomy enforces review at **meaningful boundaries**:
- when a milestone is complete
- when external effects are requested
- when risk increases

This mirrors how high-trust engineering systems already work.

---

## Future extensions (by design, not accident)

- continuous security auditor agents
- automatic least-privilege recommendations
- anomaly detection over audit logs
- richer diff renderers (spreadsheets, docs, binaries)
- multi-tenant cloud deployments
- stronger runtime isolation tiers

These are additive — not architectural rewrites.

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install TA from source

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/trustedautonomy/ta.git
cd ta

# Build (pick one):

# Option A — With Nix (reproducible, recommended for contributors)
nix develop --command cargo build --release -p ta-cli

# Option B — Without Nix (just needs Rust)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh  # if needed
cargo build --release -p ta-cli
```

The binary lands at `target/release/ta-cli`. Add it to your PATH:

```bash
# Add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
export PATH="$HOME/path-to/ta/target/release:$PATH"

# Or symlink it
ln -sf "$(pwd)/target/release/ta-cli" /usr/local/bin/ta
```

### 2. Install an agent

TA works with any coding agent. Pick one (or more):

**Claude Code** (recommended)
```bash
# Native install (preferred)
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Or via npm
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
Requires an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) or a Claude Max plan.

**Claude Flow** (multi-agent orchestration on top of Claude Code)
```bash
# Requires Node.js 20+ and Claude Code installed first
npx claude-flow@alpha init --wizard

# Or full install
curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ruvnet/claude-flow@main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --full
```
See the [claude-flow repo](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow) for configuration options.

**OpenAI Codex CLI**
```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```
Requires an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription.

### API key configuration

You can set API keys globally or per-project.

**Global** (all projects):
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

**Per-project** (recommended — uses [direnv](https://direnv.net/)):
```bash
# Copy the example and add your key
cp .envrc.example .envrc
# Edit .envrc — uncomment and set your API key
direnv allow
```

The key activates when you `cd` into the project and deactivates when you leave. The `.envrc` also contains `use flake` which auto-activates the Nix dev shell (cargo, rustc, etc.).

**Important:** `.envrc` is already in `.gitignore` — your keys will never be committed. Only `.envrc.example` (with placeholder values) is tracked in git.

### 3. Run your first mediated task

```bash
cd your-project/

# One command: create staging copy → launch agent → build PR on exit
ta run claude-code "Fix the auth bug" --source .

# TA copies your project to .ta/staging/, injects context into CLAUDE.md,
# launches Claude Code in the staging copy. Agent works normally.
# When Claude exits, TA diffs staging vs source and builds a PR package.

# Review what the agent did
ta pr list
ta pr view <package-id>

# Approve and apply changes back to your project
ta pr approve <package-id>
ta pr apply <package-id> --git-commit
```

That's it. The agent never knew it was in a staging workspace.

---

## How It Works

```
Your Project                     Staging Copy (.ta/staging/)
     |                                    |
     |-- ta run "task" --source . ------->|  (full copy, minus build artifacts)
     |                                    |
     |                              Agent works here
     |                              (reads, writes, tests — normal tools)
     |                                    |
     |                              ta pr build --latest
     |                                    |
     |<--- ta pr apply <id> -------------|  (only approved changes copied back)
     |
   Your project updated + optional git commit
```

TA is invisible to the agent. It works by:
1. Copying your project to a staging directory (with `.taignore` to skip build artifacts)
2. Letting the agent work normally in the copy using its native tools
3. Diffing the staging copy against the original to create a PR package
4. Letting you review, approve, and apply changes back

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Manual workflow (any agent)

```bash
# 1. Start a goal — creates a staging copy of your project
ta goal start "Fix the auth bug" --source .

# 2. Note the staging path and goal ID from the output, then enter staging
cd .ta/staging/<goal-id>/

# 3. Launch your agent (Claude Code, Codex, or any tool)
claude    # or: codex, or any tool

# 4. Agent works normally — reads, writes, runs tests, etc.
#    It doesn't know it's in a staging workspace.
#    When done, exit the agent.

# 5. Build a PR package from the diff
ta pr build <goal-id> --summary "Fixed the auth bug"

# 6. Review the changes
ta pr view <package-id>

# 7. Approve and apply back to your project (with optional git commit)
ta pr approve <package-id>
ta pr apply <package-id> --git-commit
```

### One-command shortcut

`ta run` wraps the manual steps into a single command:

```bash
ta run claude-code "Fix the auth bug" --source .
# Then review + approve + apply as above.
```

### Using with Claude Flow (detailed setup)

[Claude Flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow) adds multi-agent orchestration on top of Claude Code. It can run as an MCP server (giving Claude Code extra tools for swarm coordination, memory, and task routing) or launch Claude Code processes directly via its hive-mind command. Both approaches work inside a TA staging workspace.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 20+, npm 9+
- Claude Code installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- An `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in your environment

#### Step 1: Install claude-flow

```bash
# Option A: Use via npx (no global install needed)
npx claude-flow@alpha --version

# Option B: Global install
npm install -g claude-flow@alpha
```

#### Step 2: Register claude-flow as an MCP server for Claude Code

This is the primary integration — it gives Claude Code access to claude-flow's swarm, memory, and task-routing tools:

```bash
claude mcp add claude-flow -- npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start
```

Or add it to your project's `.mcp.json` (TA will copy this into staging):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-flow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["claude-flow@alpha", "mcp", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create a TA goal and staging workspace

```bash
cd your-project/
ta goal start "Refactor auth system" --source .
# Note the goal ID from the output
```

#### Step 4: Launch — pick one approach

**Approach A: TA run + MCP tools (recommended)**

Use `ta run` to launch Claude Code inside the staging workspace. Because claude-flow is registered as an MCP server, Claude Code can call swarm/memory/task tools automatically:

```bash
ta run claude-code "Refactor auth system" --source .

# Claude Code launches in .ta/staging/<goal-id>/
# It can use mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init, mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate,
# etc. alongside its normal tools.
# When Claude exits, TA diffs and builds the PR package.
```

**Approach B: Hive-mind (spawns Claude Code directly)**

Claude-flow's `hive-mind` command spawns a real Claude Code process with the task prompt:

```bash
cd .ta/staging/<goal-id>/
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Refactor auth system" --claude
# Spawns Claude Code with --dangerously-skip-permissions in the staging dir.
# When done, return to project root and build the PR:
cd your-project/
ta pr build <goal-id> --summary "Auth system refactored"
```

**Approach C: Headless swarm (no interactive session)**

For fully automated runs:

```bash
cd .ta/staging/<goal-id>/
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "Refactor auth system" --headless
# Runs to completion without interaction.
cd your-project/
ta pr build <goal-id> --summary "Auth system refactored by swarm"
```

#### Step 5: Review and apply

```bash
ta pr list
ta pr view <package-id>
ta pr approve <package-id>
ta pr apply <package-id> --git-commit
```

#### CLAUDE.md conflict note

Both TA and claude-flow write to `CLAUDE.md`. TA injects goal context and plan progress into CLAUDE.md when launching via `ta run`. If you use claude-flow's `init` command inside a staging directory, use `--skip-claude` to avoid overwriting TA's injected context:

```bash
cd .ta/staging/<goal-id>/
npx claude-flow@alpha init --minimal --skip-claude
# Sets up .claude-flow/ config without touching CLAUDE.md
```

If you need claude-flow's CLAUDE.md content (governance rules, skill definitions), append it to the existing file rather than replacing it:

```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha init --minimal --skip-claude
# Then manually merge any needed claude-flow instructions into CLAUDE.md
```

#### Environment variables

```bash
# Required
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Optional claude-flow tuning
export CLAUDE_FLOW_LOG_LEVEL=info          # debug, info, warn, error
export CLAUDE_FLOW_MAX_AGENTS=12           # max concurrent agents
export CLAUDE_FLOW_NON_INTERACTIVE=true    # for CI/headless runs
export CLAUDE_FLOW_MEMORY_BACKEND=hybrid   # memory persistence backend
```

### Using with OpenAI Codex

```bash
# Same workflow — TA doesn't care which agent you use
ta goal start "Add input validation" --source .
cd .ta/staging/<goal-id>/
codex    # Codex works in the staging copy like normal
# Exit Codex, then build/review/apply as above
```

### Exclude patterns (.taignore)

By default, TA excludes common build artifacts from the staging copy (`target/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, etc.) to keep copies fast. To customize, create a `.taignore` file in your project root:

```
# .taignore — one pattern per line
# Lines starting with # are comments

# Rust
target/

# Custom project-specific excludes
large-data/
*.sqlite
```

If no `.taignore` exists, sensible defaults are used. The `.ta/` directory is always excluded.

---

## Review Workflow

```bash
ta pr list                            # List pending PRs
ta pr view <package-id>               # View details + diffs
ta pr approve <package-id>            # Approve
ta pr deny <package-id> --reason "x"  # Deny with reason
ta pr apply <package-id> --git-commit # Apply + commit
```

---

## Alternative: MCP-Native Tools

For agents that support MCP tool integration directly, TA can also expose tools via MCP instead of the overlay approach:

```bash
# Install the Claude Code adapter (generates .mcp.json + .ta/config.toml)
ta adapter install claude-code

# Start Claude Code — TA tools appear alongside built-in tools
claude
```

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `ta_goal_start` | Create a GoalRun (allocates staging workspace + capabilities) |
| `ta_fs_read` | Read a source file (snapshots the original) |
| `ta_fs_write` | Write to staging (creates a ChangeSet with diff) |
| `ta_fs_list` | List staged files |
| `ta_fs_diff` | Show diff for a staged file |
| `ta_pr_build` | Bundle staged changes into a PR package for review |
| `ta_pr_status` | Check PR package status |
| `ta_goal_status` | Check GoalRun state |
| `ta_goal_list` | List all GoalRuns |

---

## Architecture

```
Transparent overlay mode (recommended):
  Agent works in staging copy (native tools)
    → TA diffs staging vs source
    → PR Package → Human Review → Approve → Apply

MCP-native mode:
  Agent (Claude Code / Codex / any MCP client)
    |  MCP stdio
    v
  TaGatewayServer (ta-mcp-gateway)
    |-- PolicyEngine (ta-policy)        default deny
    |-- StagingWorkspace (ta-workspace)  all writes staged
    |-- ChangeStore (ta-workspace)       JSONL persistence
    |-- AuditLog (ta-audit)             tamper-evident trail
    '-- GoalRunStore (ta-goal)          lifecycle management
    |
    v
  PR Package → Human Review (CLI) → Approve → Apply
```

Multiple agents can work simultaneously. Each gets an isolated GoalRun with its own staging workspace and capabilities.

## Contributing

### Prerequisites

**Option A: Using Nix (recommended)**

```bash
# 1. Install Nix (Determinate Systems installer — adds shell integration automatically)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install

# 2. Open a NEW terminal (so nix-daemon.sh is sourced), then:
cd path/to/TrustedAutonomy
nix develop   # enters dev shell with Rust 1.93, cargo, just, clippy, rustfmt
```

> **Note:** Nix provides `cargo`, `rustc`, `clippy`, and `rustfmt` inside the dev shell only — they are not installed globally. You must either run `nix develop` first or use the `./dev` wrapper script.

**Option A+ (automatic dev shell with direnv)**

If you install [direnv](https://direnv.net/), the dev shell activates automatically when you `cd` into the project:

```bash
# macOS
brew install direnv

# Add to ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bashrc):
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"

# Then allow the project's .envrc:
cd path/to/TrustedAutonomy
direnv allow
# Now cargo, rustc, just, etc. are available automatically in this directory
```

**Option B: Without Nix**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# macOS: brew install openssl pkg-config
# Ubuntu: apt install libssl-dev pkg-config
```

### Build and test

```bash
# Inside nix develop (or with direnv active):
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Or without entering the dev shell (one-shot wrapper):
./dev cargo test --workspace
./dev cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

---

## Status

## Philosophy (tl;dr)

> Autonomy is not about removing humans.
>  
> It’s about **moving human involvement to the right abstraction layer**.

Trusted Autonomy exists to make that layer explicit, enforceable, and trustworthy.
