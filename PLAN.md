# Trusted Autonomy — Development Plan

> Canonical plan for the project. Machine-parseable: each phase has a `<!-- status: done|in_progress|pending -->` marker.
> Updated automatically by `ta pr apply` when a goal with `--phase` completes.

## Versioning & Release Policy

### Plan Phases vs Release Versions

Plan phases use hierarchical IDs for readability (e.g., `v0.4.1.1`). Release versions use strict [semver](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-prerelease`). The mapping:

| Plan Phase Format | Release Version | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `vX.Y` | `X.Y.0-alpha` | v0.4 → `0.4.0-alpha` |
| `vX.Y.Z` | `X.Y.Z-alpha` | v0.4.1 → `0.4.1-alpha` |
| `vX.Y.Z.N` (sub-phase) | `X.Y.Z-alpha.N` | v0.4.1.2 → `0.4.1-alpha.2` |

**Rule**: The plan phase ID directly determines the release version. No separate mapping table needed — apply the formula above.

### Pre-release Lifecycle

| Tag | Meaning | Criteria to Enter |
|---|---|---|
| `alpha` | Active development. APIs may change. Not recommended for production. | Default for all `0.x` work |
| `beta` | Feature-complete for the release cycle. APIs stabilizing. Suitable for early adopters. | All planned phases for the minor version are done; no known critical bugs |
| `rc.N` | Release candidate. Only bug fixes accepted. | Beta testing complete; no API changes expected |
| *(none)* | Stable public release. Semver guarantees apply. | RC period passes without blocking issues |

**Current lifecycle**: All `0.x` releases are `alpha`. Beta begins when the core loop is proven (target: `v0.8` Department Runtime). Stable `1.0.0` requires: all v0.x features hardened, public API frozen, security audit complete.

**Version progression example**:
```
0.4.1-alpha → 0.4.1-alpha.1 → 0.4.1-alpha.2 → 0.4.2-alpha → ...
0.8.0-alpha → 0.8.0-beta → 0.8.0-rc.1 → 0.8.0
1.0.0-beta → 1.0.0-rc.1 → 1.0.0
```

### Release Mechanics

- **Release tags**: Each `vX.Y.0` phase is a **release point** — cut a git tag and publish binaries.
- **Patch phases** (`vX.Y.1`, `vX.Y.2`) are incremental work within a release cycle.
- **Sub-phases** (`vX.Y.Z.N`) use pre-release dot notation: `ta release run X.Y.Z-alpha.N`
- **When completing a phase**, the implementing agent MUST:
  1. Update `version` in `apps/ta-cli/Cargo.toml` to the phase's release version
  2. Update the "Current State" section in `CLAUDE.md` with the new version and test count
  3. Mark the phase as `done` in this file
- **Pre-v0.1 phases** (Phase 0–4c) used internal numbering. All phases from v0.1 onward use version-based naming.

## Standards & Compliance Reference

TA's architecture maps to emerging AI governance standards. Rather than bolt-on compliance, these standards inform design decisions at the phase where they naturally apply. References below indicate where TA's existing or planned capabilities satisfy a standard's requirements.

| Standard | Relevance to TA | Phase(s) |
|---|---|---|
| **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** (AI Management Systems) | Audit trail integrity (hash-chained logs), documented capability grants, human oversight records | Phase 1 (done), v0.3.3 |
| **ISO/IEC 42005:2025** (AI Impact Assessment) | Risk scoring per draft, policy decision records, impact statements in summaries | Phase 4b (done), v0.3.3 |
| **IEEE 7001-2021** (Transparency of Autonomous Systems) | Structured decision reasoning, alternatives considered, observable policy enforcement | v0.3.3, v0.4.0 |
| **IEEE 3152-2024** (Human/Machine Agency Identification) | Agent identity declarations, capability manifests, constitution references | Phase 2 (done), v0.4.0 |
| **EU AI Act Article 14** (Human Oversight) | Human-in-the-loop checkpoint, approve/reject per artifact, audit trail of decisions | Phase 3 (done), v0.3.0 (done) |
| **EU AI Act Article 50** (Transparency Obligations) | Transparent interception of external actions, human-readable action summaries | v0.5.0, v0.7.1 |
| **Singapore IMDA Agentic AI Framework** (Jan 2026) | Agent boundaries, network governance, multi-agent coordination alignment | v0.6.0, v0.7.x, v1.0 |
| **NIST AI RMF 1.0** (AI Risk Management) | Risk-proportional review, behavioral drift monitoring, escalation triggers | v0.3.3, v0.4.2 |

> **Design principle**: TA achieves compliance through architectural enforcement (staging + policy + checkpoint), not self-declaration. An agent's compliance is *verified by TA's constraints*, not *claimed by the agent*. This is stronger than transparency-only protocols like [AAP](https://github.com/mnemom/aap) — TA doesn't ask agents to declare alignment; it enforces boundaries regardless of what agents declare.

## Completed Phases (Phase 0 through v0.8)

> **Archived**: Phases 0–4c, v0.1–v0.1.2, v0.2.0–v0.2.4, v0.3.0–v0.3.6, v0.4.0–v0.4.5, v0.5.0–v0.5.7, v0.6.0–v0.6.3, v0.7.0–v0.7.7, v0.8.0–v0.8.2 have been moved to [`docs/PLAN-ARCHIVE.md`](docs/PLAN-ARCHIVE.md).
> All are `<!-- status: done -->` except v0.1 and v0.1.1 which are `<!-- status: deferred -->`.

## Release Sequence & Phase Priority

### Road to Public Alpha

External users (working on their own projects, not TA itself) need these phases completed in order before TA is ready for public alpha. All other phases are post-alpha.

| Phase | Why required |
|---|---|
| **v0.11.7** | Shell stream UX + VCS trait generalization — foundational for next phases |
| **v0.12.0** + §16.6 extraction | `ta new` / `setup.sh` onboarding + remove TA-specific scanner from generic pipeline |
| **v0.12.0.1** | PR merge + main sync completion — the missing post-apply workflow step |
| **v0.13.5** | VCS Adapter Externalization — first users include Perforce shops; P4 must be external plugin |
| ⬇ **PUBLIC ALPHA** | TA can be set up on a new project, plan built, goals run, drafts applied, PRs merged, main synced — in git or P4, from `ta shell` + Discord/Slack |

### Pre-Alpha Bugs to Fix (must resolve before external release)

- **Follow-up draft captures per-session delta, not full staging-vs-source diff**: When `ta run --follow-up` creates a child draft, `ta draft build` should diff the *full staging state* against current source — capturing all accumulated changes from the parent session + child session. Currently it appears to capture only what the child agent session wrote. Result: applying a child draft produces partial changes, and apply-time validation fails with compile errors that exist in source but not in staging. This confuses agents doing follow-up work ("the build is clean!") and requires multiple follow-up chains to complete simple fix tasks. Fix: ensure `ta draft build` always performs a full `diff(staging, source)` regardless of session depth.

### Post-Alpha: Near-Term

| Phase | Notes |
|---|---|
| v0.12.1 | Reflink/COW — perf optimization, not blocking |
| v0.12.2 | Self-healing daemon — makes the loop more robust |
| v0.13.3 | External Action Governance — needed when agents send emails/API calls/posts |
| v0.13.4 | Database Proxy Plugins — depends on v0.13.3 |
| v0.14.1 | Full Constitution Framework — §16.6 is pulled into v0.12.0 (scanner extraction); the remaining constitution tooling can be post-alpha |

### Enterprise (Deferred)

Needed for compliance-focused or container-isolated deployments; not blocking for initial external release.

- v0.13.0 — Compliance-Ready Audit Ledger
- v0.13.1 — MCP Transport Abstraction (SecureTA/container enabler; runtime adapters depend on this)
- v0.13.2 — Runtime Adapter Trait (SecureTA/OCI; depends on v0.13.1)

### Deferred / May Drop

- v0.12.3 — Community Knowledge Hub (post-launch community feature)
- v0.13.6 — Shell Mouse Scroll (TUI may be dropped; web shell is default)

### Advanced (Post-Alpha)

- v0.14.0 — Goal Workflows: Serial Chains, Parallel Swarms & Office Routing

- Enterprise state intercept → v0.11.5 (Runtime Adapter Trait)

### v0.9.3 — Dev Loop Access Hardening
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Severely limit what the `ta dev` orchestrator agent can do — read-only project access, only TA MCP tools, no filesystem writes.

**Completed:**
- ✅ `--allowedTools` enforcement: agent config restricts to `mcp__ta__*` + read-only builtins. No Write, Edit, Bash, NotebookEdit.
- ✅ `.mcp.json` scoping: `inject_mcp_server_config_with_session()` passes `TA_DEV_SESSION_ID` and `TA_CALLER_MODE` env vars to the MCP server for per-session audit and policy enforcement.
- ✅ Policy enforcement: `CallerMode` enum (`Normal`/`Orchestrator`/`Unrestricted`) in MCP gateway. `ta_fs_write` blocked at gateway level in orchestrator mode. Security Boundaries section in system prompt.
- ✅ Audit trail: `write_dev_audit()` logs session start/end with session ID, mode, exit status to `.ta/dev-audit.log`. `TA_DEV_SESSION_ID` env var passed to agent process and MCP server for correlation.
- ✅ Escape hatch: `ta dev --unrestricted` bypasses restrictions, logs warning, removes `--allowedTools` from agent config.
- ✅ `dev-loop.yaml` alignment profile: `forbidden_actions` includes `fs_write_patch`, `fs_apply`, `shell_execute`, `network_external`, `credential_access`, `notebook_edit`.
- ✅ 12 tests: prompt security boundaries, unrestricted warning, config loading (restricted/unrestricted), audit logging, MCP injection with session, CallerMode enforcement.
- ✅ Version bump to 0.9.3-alpha.

**Deferred items resolved:**
- Sandbox runtime integration → v0.11.5 (Runtime Adapter Trait)
- Full tool-call audit logging → completed in v0.10.15 (per-tool-call audit via `audit_tool_call()`)

### v0.9.4 — Orchestrator Event Wiring & Gateway Refactor
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Wire the `ta dev` orchestrator to actually launch implementation agents, handle failures, and receive events — plus refactor the growing MCP gateway.

1. **Fix `ta_goal_start` MCP → full agent launch**: Currently `ta_goal_start` via MCP only creates goal metadata — it doesn't copy the project to staging, inject CLAUDE.md, or launch the agent process. The orchestrator (`ta dev`) cannot actually launch implementation agents. Wire `ta_goal_start` (and `ta_goal_inner` with `launch:true`) to perform the full `ta run` lifecycle: overlay workspace copy → context injection → agent spawn. This is the critical blocker for `ta dev` orchestration.
2. **`GoalFailed` / `GoalError` event**: Add a `GoalFailed { goal_run_id, error, exit_code, timestamp }` variant to `TaEvent` in `crates/ta-goal/src/events.rs`. Emit it when an agent process exits with a non-zero code, crashes, or when the workspace setup fails. Currently agent failures are silent — the goal stays in "running" forever.
3. **MCP event subscription tool**: Add `ta_event_subscribe` (or similar) to the MCP gateway that lets orchestrator agents receive events without polling. Options: SSE-style streaming, long-poll, or callback registration. The orchestrator should be notified when a goal completes, fails, or produces a draft — not burn context window on repeated identical polls.
4. **MCP gateway `server.rs` refactor**: Split the 2,200+ line `server.rs` into modules by domain:
   - `server.rs` → State, config, CallerMode, ServerHandler dispatch (~200 lines)
   - `tools/goal.rs` → `ta_goal_start`, `ta_goal_status`, `ta_goal_list`, `ta_goal_inner`
   - `tools/fs.rs` → `ta_fs_read`, `ta_fs_write`, `ta_fs_list`, `ta_fs_diff`
   - `tools/draft.rs` → `ta_draft`, `ta_pr_build`, `ta_pr_status`
   - `tools/plan.rs` → `ta_plan`
   - `tools/context.rs` → `ta_context`
   - `validation.rs` → `parse_uuid`, `enforce_policy`, `validate_goal_exists` (shared helpers)

**Completed:**
- [x] `GoalFailed` event variant added to `TaEvent` (ta-goal/events.rs) and `SessionEvent` (ta-events/schema.rs) with helper constructors, serialization tests
- [x] `ta_event_subscribe` MCP tool with query/watch/latest actions, cursor-based pagination, type/goal/time filtering
- [x] MCP gateway refactored: `server.rs` split into `tools/{goal,fs,draft,plan,context,event}.rs` + `validation.rs`
- [x] `GoalFailed` emitted on agent launch failure in `ta_goal_inner` with `launch:true`, transitions goal to Failed state
- [x] `ta dev` prompt and allowed-tools list updated to include `ta_event_subscribe`
- [x] 14 MCP tools (was 13), 30 gateway tests pass, 2 new GoalFailed event tests

---                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
### v0.9.4.1 — Event Emission Plumbing Fix                       
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Wire event emission into all goal lifecycle paths so `ta_event_subscribe` actually receives events. Currently only `GoalFailed` on spawn failure emits to FsEventStore — `GoalStarted`, `GoalCompleted`, and `DraftBuilt` are never written, making
the event subscription system non-functional for orchestrator agents.                
                                                                
**Bug**: `ta_goal_start` (MCP) creates goal metadata but does NOT: copy project to staging, inject CLAUDE.md, or launch the agent process. Goals created via MCP are stuck in `running` with no workspace and no agent. The full `ta run` lifecycle must be
wired into the MCP goal start path.

#### Completed
- ✅ **`ta_goal_start` MCP → full lifecycle**: `ta_goal_start` now always launches the implementation agent. Added `source` and `phase` parameters, always spawns `ta run --headless` which performs overlay copy, CLAUDE.md injection, agent spawn, draft build, and event emission. Goals created via MCP now actually execute — fixing `ta dev`.
- ✅ **Emit `GoalStarted`**: Both MCP `handle_goal_start()`, `handle_goal_inner()`, and CLI `ta run` emit `SessionEvent::GoalStarted` to FsEventStore after goal creation.
- ✅ **Emit `GoalCompleted`**: CLI `ta run` emits `GoalCompleted` on agent exit code 0. MCP agent launch delegates to `ta run --headless` which emits events.
- ✅ **Emit `DraftBuilt`**: Both MCP `handle_pr_build()`, `handle_draft_build()`, and CLI `ta draft build` emit `DraftBuilt` to FsEventStore.
- ✅ **Emit `GoalFailed` on all failure paths**: CLI `ta run` emits `GoalFailed` on non-zero exit code and launch failure. MCP `launch_goal_agent` and `launch_sub_goal_agent` emit on spawn failure.
- ✅ **End-to-end integration test** (3 tests in `crates/ta-mcp-gateway/src/tools/event.rs`): lifecycle event emission + goal_id/event_type filtering + cursor-based watch pattern.
- ✅ **Cursor-based watch test**: Verifies query-with-cursor polling pattern works correctly.

#### Version: `0.9.4-alpha.1`

### v0.9.5 — Enhanced Draft View Output
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Make `ta draft view` output clear and actionable for reviewers — structured "what changed" summaries, design alternatives considered, and grouped visual sections.

#### Completed

- ✅ **Grouped change summary**: `ta draft view` shows a module-grouped file list with per-file classification (created/modified/deleted), one-line "what" and "why", and dependency annotations (which changes depend on each other vs. independent).
- ✅ **Alternatives considered**: New `alternatives_considered: Vec<DesignAlternative>` field on `Summary`. Each entry has `option`, `rationale`, `chosen: bool`. Populated by agents via new optional `alternatives` parameter on `ta_pr_build` MCP tool. Displayed under "Design Decisions" heading in `ta draft view`.
- ✅ **Structured view sections**: `ta draft view` output organized as Summary → What Changed → Design Decisions → Artifacts.
- ✅ **`--json` on `ta draft view`**: Full structured JSON output for programmatic consumption (already existed; now includes new fields).
- ✅ 7 new tests (3 in draft_package.rs, 4 in terminal.rs).

#### Version: `0.9.5-alpha`

---                                                  
### v0.9.5.1 — Goal Lifecycle Hygiene & Orchestrator Fixes                                                                                                                                                                                                      
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix the bugs discovered during v0.9.5 goal lifecycle monitoring — duplicate goal creation, zombie goal cleanup, event timer accuracy, draft discoverability via MCP, and cursor-based event polling semantics.                                        
                                                                                      
#### Items                                           
                                                
1. **Fix duplicate goal creation from `ta_goal_start`**: `ta_goal_start` (MCP tool in `tools/goal.rs`) creates a goal record + emits `GoalStarted`, then spawns `ta run --headless` which creates a *second* goal for the same work. The MCP goal (`3917d3bc`)
becomes an orphan — no staging directory, no completion event, stuck in `running` forever. Fix: pass the goal_run_id from `ta_goal_start` to `ta run --headless` via a `--goal-id` flag so the subprocess reuses the existing goal record instead of creating a
new one. The MCP tool should own goal creation; `ta run --headless --goal-id <id>` should skip `GoalRun::new()` and load the existing goal.
      
2. **Fix `duration_secs: 0` in `GoalCompleted` event**: The `goal_completed` event emitted by `ta run` (in `run.rs`) reports `duration_secs: 0` even when the agent ran for ~12 minutes. The `Instant` timer is likely created at the wrong point (after agent
exit instead of before agent launch), or `duration_secs` is computed incorrectly. Fix: ensure the timer starts immediately before agent process spawn and `duration_secs` is `start.elapsed().as_secs()` at emission time.

3. **Fix `ta_draft list` MCP tool returning empty**: The `ta_draft` MCP tool with action `list` returns `{"count":0,"drafts":[]}` even when a draft package exists at `.ta/pr_packages/<id>.json`. The MCP `handle_draft_list()` searches `state.pr_packages`
(in-memory HashMap) which is only populated during the gateway's session lifetime. Drafts built by a *different* process (the `ta run --headless` subprocess) write to disk but the orchestrator's gateway never loads them. Fix: `handle_draft_list()` should
fall back to scanning `.ta/pr_packages/*.json` on disk when the in-memory map is empty, or always merge disk packages into the list.

4. **Fix cursor-inclusive event polling**: `ta_event_subscribe` with `since` returns events at exactly the `since` timestamp (inclusive/`>=`), so cursor-based polling re-fetches the last event every time. Fix: change the filter to strictly-after (`>`) so
passing the cursor from the previous response returns only *new* events. Add a test: emit event at T1, query with `since=T1` → expect 0 results; emit event at T2, query with `since=T1` → expect 1 result (T2 only).

5. **`ta goal gc` command**: New CLI command to clean up zombie goals and stale staging directories. Behavior:
    - List all goals in `.ta/goals/` with state `running` whose `updated_at` is older than a configurable threshold (default: 7 days). Transition them to `failed` with reason "gc: stale goal exceeded threshold".
    - For each non-terminal goal that has no corresponding staging directory, transition to `failed` with reason "gc: missing staging workspace".
    - `--dry-run` flag to preview what would be cleaned without making changes.
    - `--include-staging` flag to also delete staging directories for terminal-state goals (completed, failed, applied).
    - Print summary: "Transitioned N zombie goals to failed. Reclaimed M staging directories (X GB)."

6. **`ta draft gc` enhancement**: Extend existing `ta draft gc` to also clean orphaned `.ta/pr_packages/*.json` files whose linked goal is in a terminal state and older than the stale threshold.

#### Completed
- ✅ Fix duplicate goal creation: `ta_goal_start` now passes `--goal-id` to `ta run --headless` so subprocess reuses existing goal record
- ✅ Fix `duration_secs: 0`: Timer moved before agent launch (was incorrectly placed after)
- ✅ Fix `ta_draft list` MCP returning empty: `handle_draft_list()` now merges on-disk packages with in-memory map
- ✅ Fix cursor-inclusive event polling: `since` filter changed from `>=` to `>` (strictly-after) with updated cursor test
- ✅ `ta goal gc` command: zombie detection, missing-staging detection, `--dry-run`, `--include-staging`, `--threshold-days`
- ✅ `ta draft gc` enhancement: now also cleans orphaned pr_package JSON files for terminal goals past stale threshold

#### Implementation scope
- `crates/ta-mcp-gateway/src/tools/goal.rs` — pass goal_run_id to `ta run --headless`, add `--goal-id` flag handling
- `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/run.rs` — accept `--goal-id` flag, reuse existing goal record, fix duration timer placement
- `crates/ta-mcp-gateway/src/tools/draft.rs` — disk-based fallback in `handle_draft_list()`
- `crates/ta-mcp-gateway/src/tools/event.rs` — change `since` filter from `>=` to `>`, add cursor exclusivity test
- `crates/ta-events/src/store.rs` — `since` filter semantics changed to strictly-after
- `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/goal.rs` — new `gc` subcommand with `--dry-run`, `--include-staging`, and `--threshold-days` flags
- `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/draft.rs` — extend `gc` to clean orphaned pr_packages
- `apps/ta-cli/src/main.rs` — wire `goal gc` subcommand and `--goal-id` flag on `ta run`
- Tests: cursor exclusivity test updated, goal gc test added

#### Version: `0.9.5-alpha.1`

### v0.9.6 — Orchestrator API & Goal-Scoped Agent Tracking
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Make MCP tools work without a `goal_run_id` for read-only project-wide operations, and track which agents are working on which goals for observability.

#### Items

1. **Optional `goal_run_id` on read-only MCP calls**: Make `goal_run_id` optional on tools that make sense at the project scope. If provided, scope to that goal's workspace. If omitted, use the project root. Affected tools:
   - `ta_plan read` — reads PLAN.md from project root when no goal_run_id
   - `ta_goal list` — drop goal_run_id requirement entirely (listing is always project-wide)
   - `ta_draft list` — list all drafts project-wide when no goal_run_id
   - `ta_context search/stats/list` — memory is already project-scoped
   - Keep `goal_run_id` **required** on mutation calls: `ta_plan update`, `ta_draft build/submit`, `ta_goal start` (inner), `ta_goal update`

2. **Goal-scoped agent tracking**: Track which agent sessions are actively working on each goal. New `AgentSession` struct:
   ```rust
   pub struct AgentSession {
       pub agent_id: String,        // unique per session (e.g., PID or UUID)
       pub agent_type: String,      // "claude-code", "codex", "custom"
       pub goal_run_id: Option<Uuid>, // None for orchestrator
       pub caller_mode: CallerMode,
       pub started_at: DateTime<Utc>,
       pub last_heartbeat: DateTime<Utc>,
   }
   ```
   Stored in `GatewayState.active_agents: HashMap<String, AgentSession>`. Populated when a tool call arrives (extract from `TA_AGENT_ID` env var or generate on first call). Emits `AgentSessionStarted` / `AgentSessionEnded` events.

3. **`ta_agent_status` MCP tool**: New tool for the orchestrator to query active agents:
   - `action: "list"` — returns all active agent sessions with their goal associations
   - `action: "status"` — returns a specific agent's current state
   - Useful for diagnostics: "which agents are running? are any stuck?"

4. **`CallerMode` policy enforcement**: When `CallerMode::Orchestrator`, enforce:
   - Read-only access to plan, drafts, context (no mutations without a goal)
   - Can call `ta_goal start` to create new goals
   - Cannot call `ta_draft build/submit` directly (must be inside a goal)
   - Policy engine logs the caller mode in audit entries for observability

5. **`ta status` CLI command**: Project-wide status dashboard:
   ```
   $ ta status
   Project: TrustedAutonomy (v0.9.6-alpha)
   Next phase: v0.9.5.1 — Goal Lifecycle Hygiene

   Active agents:
     agent-1 (claude-code) → goal abc123 "Implement v0.9.5.1" [running 12m]
     agent-2 (claude-code) → orchestrator [idle]

   Pending drafts: 2
   Active goals: 1
   ```

### v0.9.7 — Daemon API Expansion
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Promote the TA daemon from a draft-review web UI to a full API server that any interface (terminal, web, Discord, Slack, email) can connect to for commands, agent conversations, and event streams.

#### Architecture

```
         Any Interface
              │
              ▼
    TA Daemon (HTTP API)
    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
    │  /api/cmd      — run ta CLI │
    │  /api/agent    — talk to AI │
    │  /api/events   — SSE stream │
    │  /api/status   — project    │
    │  /api/drafts   — review     │  (existing)
    │  /api/memory   — context    │  (existing)
    ├─────────────────────────────┤
    │  Auth: Bearer token or mTLS │
    │  CORS: configurable origins │
    │  Rate limit: per-token      │
    └─────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Items

1. **Command execution API** (`POST /api/cmd`): Execute any `ta` CLI command and return the output. The daemon forks the `ta` binary with the provided arguments, captures stdout/stderr, and returns them as JSON.
   ```json
   // Request
   { "command": "ta draft list" }
   // Response
   { "exit_code": 0, "stdout": "ID  Status  Title\nabc  pending  Fix auth\n", "stderr": "" }
   ```
   - Command allowlist in `.ta/daemon.toml` — by default, all read commands allowed; write commands (approve, deny, apply, goal start) require explicit opt-in or elevated token scope.
   - Execution timeout: configurable, default 30 seconds.

2. **Agent session API** (`/api/agent/*`): Manage a headless agent subprocess that persists across requests. The daemon owns the agent's lifecycle.
   - `POST /api/agent/start` — Start a new agent session. Launches the configured agent in headless mode with MCP sidecar. Returns a `session_id`.
     ```json
     { "agent": "claude-code", "context": "optional initial prompt" }
     → { "session_id": "sess-abc123", "status": "running" }
     ```
   - `POST /api/agent/ask` — Send a prompt to the active agent session and stream the response.
     ```json
     { "session_id": "sess-abc123", "prompt": "What should we work on next?" }
     → SSE stream of agent response chunks
     ```
   - `GET /api/agent/sessions` — List active agent sessions.
   - `DELETE /api/agent/:session_id` — Stop an agent session.
   - Agent sessions respect the same routing config (`.ta/shell.toml`) — if the "prompt" looks like a command, the daemon can auto-route it to `/api/cmd` instead. This makes every interface behave like `ta shell`.

3. **Event stream API** (`GET /api/events`): Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint that streams TA events in real-time.
   - Subscribes to the `FsEventStore` (same as `ta shell` would).
   - Supports `?since=<cursor>` for replay from a point.
   - Event types: `draft_built`, `draft_approved`, `draft_denied`, `goal_started`, `goal_completed`, `goal_failed`, `drift_detected`, `agent_session_started`, `agent_session_ended`.
   - Each event includes `id` (cursor), `type`, `timestamp`, and `data` (JSON payload).
   ```
   event: draft_built
   id: evt-001
   data: {"draft_id":"abc123","title":"Fix auth","artifact_count":3}

   event: goal_completed
   id: evt-002
   data: {"goal_run_id":"def456","title":"Phase 1","duration_secs":720}
   ```

4. **Project status API** (`GET /api/status`): Single endpoint returning the full project dashboard — same data as `ta status` (v0.9.6) but as JSON.
   ```json
   {
     "project": "TrustedAutonomy",
     "version": "0.9.8-alpha",
     "current_phase": { "id": "v0.9.5.1", "title": "Goal Lifecycle Hygiene", "status": "pending" },
     "active_agents": [
       { "agent_id": "agent-1", "type": "claude-code", "goal": "abc123", "running_secs": 720 }
     ],
     "pending_drafts": 2,
     "active_goals": 1,
     "recent_events": [ ... ]
   }
   ```

5. **Authentication & authorization**: Bearer token authentication for remote access.
   - Token management: `ta daemon token create --scope read,write` → generates a random token stored in `.ta/daemon-tokens.json`.
   - Scopes: `read` (status, list, view, events), `write` (approve, deny, apply, goal start, agent ask), `admin` (daemon config, token management).
   - Local connections (127.0.0.1) can optionally bypass auth for solo use.
   - Token is passed via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
   - All API calls logged to audit trail with the token identity.

6. **Daemon configuration** (`.ta/daemon.toml`):
   ```toml
   [server]
   bind = "127.0.0.1"       # "0.0.0.0" for remote access
   port = 7700
   cors_origins = ["*"]      # restrict in production

   [auth]
   require_token = true       # false for local-only use
   local_bypass = true        # skip auth for 127.0.0.1

   [commands]
   # Allowlist for /api/cmd (glob patterns)
   allowed = ["ta draft *", "ta goal *", "ta plan *", "ta status", "ta context *"]
   # Commands that require write scope
   write_commands = ["ta draft approve *", "ta draft deny *", "ta draft apply *", "ta goal start *"]

   [agent]
   max_sessions = 3           # concurrent agent sessions
   idle_timeout_secs = 3600   # kill idle sessions after 1 hour
   default_agent = "claude-code"

   [routing]
   use_shell_config = true    # use .ta/shell.toml for command vs agent routing
   ```

7. **Bridge protocol update**: Update the Discord/Slack/Gmail bridge templates to use the daemon API instead of file-based exchange. The bridges become thin HTTP clients:
   - Message received → `POST /api/cmd` or `/api/agent/ask`
   - Subscribe to `GET /api/events` for notifications
   - No more file watching or exchange directory

#### Implementation scope
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/api/mod.rs` — API module organization
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/api/cmd.rs` — command execution endpoint
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/api/agent.rs` — agent session management, headless subprocess, SSE streaming
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/api/events.rs` — SSE event stream from FsEventStore
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/api/status.rs` — project status endpoint
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/api/auth.rs` — token authentication, scope enforcement
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/web.rs` — integrate new API routes alongside existing draft/memory routes
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/api/input.rs` — unified `/api/input` endpoint with routing table dispatch
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/api/router.rs` — `.ta/shell.toml` parsing, prefix matching, shortcut expansion
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/socket.rs` — Unix domain socket listener (`.ta/daemon.sock`)
- `crates/ta-daemon/Cargo.toml` — add `tokio-stream` (SSE), `rand` (token gen), `hyperlocal` (Unix socket)
- `templates/daemon.toml` — default daemon configuration
- `templates/shell.toml` — default routing config (routes + shortcuts)
- `templates/channels/discord-bridge-api.js` — updated bridge using daemon API
- `templates/channels/slack-bridge-api.js` — updated bridge using daemon API
- `docs/USAGE.md` — daemon API documentation, remote access setup, routing customization
- Tests: command execution with auth, agent session lifecycle, SSE event stream, token scope enforcement, input routing dispatch, Unix socket connectivity

8. **Configurable input routing** (`.ta/shell.toml`): The daemon uses this config to decide whether input is a command or an agent prompt. Shared by all interfaces — `ta shell`, web UI, Discord/Slack bridges all route through the same logic.
   ```toml
   # Routes: prefix → local command execution
   # Anything not matching a route goes to the agent
   [[routes]]
   prefix = "ta "           # "ta draft list" → runs `ta draft list`
   command = "ta"
   strip_prefix = true

   [[routes]]
   prefix = "git "
   command = "git"
   strip_prefix = true

   [[routes]]
   prefix = "cargo "
   command = "./dev cargo"   # project's nix wrapper
   strip_prefix = true

   [[routes]]
   prefix = "!"             # shell escape: "!ls -la" → runs "ls -la"
   command = "sh"
   args = ["-c"]
   strip_prefix = true

   # Shortcuts: keyword → expanded command
   [[shortcuts]]
   match = "approve"         # "approve abc123" → "ta draft approve abc123"
   expand = "ta draft approve"

   [[shortcuts]]
   match = "deny"
   expand = "ta draft deny"

   [[shortcuts]]
   match = "view"
   expand = "ta draft view"

   [[shortcuts]]
   match = "apply"
   expand = "ta draft apply"

   [[shortcuts]]
   match = "status"
   expand = "ta status"

   [[shortcuts]]
   match = "plan"
   expand = "ta plan list"

   [[shortcuts]]
   match = "goals"
   expand = "ta goal list"

   [[shortcuts]]
   match = "drafts"
   expand = "ta draft list"
   ```
   - Default routing built in if no `.ta/shell.toml` exists
   - `POST /api/input` — unified endpoint: daemon checks routing table, dispatches to `/api/cmd` or `/api/agent/ask` accordingly. Clients don't need to know the routing rules — they just send the raw input.

9. **Unix socket for local clients**: In addition to HTTP, the daemon listens on `.ta/daemon.sock` (Unix domain socket). Local clients (`ta shell`, web UI) connect here for zero-config, zero-auth, low-latency access. Remote clients use HTTP with bearer token auth.

#### Completed
- [x] Command execution API (`POST /api/cmd`) with allowlist validation, write scope enforcement, configurable timeout
- [x] Agent session API (`/api/agent/start`, `/api/agent/ask`, `/api/agent/sessions`, `DELETE /api/agent/:id`) with session lifecycle management and max session limits
- [x] SSE event stream API (`GET /api/events`) with cursor-based replay (`?since=`) and event type filtering (`?types=`)
- [x] Project status API (`GET /api/status`) with JSON dashboard (project, version, phase, agents, drafts, events)
- [x] Bearer token authentication middleware with scopes (read/write/admin), local bypass for 127.0.0.1
- [x] Token store (`TokenStore`) with create/validate/revoke persisted in `.ta/daemon-tokens.json`
- [x] Daemon configuration (`.ta/daemon.toml`) with server, auth, commands, agent, routing sections
- [x] Configurable input routing (`.ta/shell.toml`) with prefix-based routes and shortcut expansion
- [x] Unified input endpoint (`POST /api/input`) dispatching to cmd or agent via routing table
- [x] Route listing endpoint (`GET /api/routes`) for tab completion
- [x] Combined router merging new API routes with existing draft/memory web UI routes
- [x] API-only mode (`--api` flag) and co-hosted MCP+API mode
- [x] Default template files (`templates/daemon.toml`, `templates/shell.toml`)
- [x] Version bumps: ta-daemon 0.9.7-alpha, ta-cli 0.9.7-alpha
- [x] 35 tests: config roundtrip, token CRUD, session lifecycle/limits, input routing, glob matching, status parsing, auth scopes

#### Deferred items moved
- Unix domain socket listener → v0.11.4 (MCP Transport Abstraction)
- Headless agent subprocess → superseded by TUI shell (v0.9.8.3)
- Bridge template updates → superseded by external plugin architecture (v0.10.2)

#### Version: `0.9.7-alpha`

### v0.9.8 — Interactive TA Shell (`ta shell`)
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: A thin terminal REPL client for the TA daemon — providing a single-terminal interactive experience for commands, agent conversation, and event notifications. The shell is a daemon client, not a standalone tool.

#### Architecture

```

```

#### Design: Shell as Daemon Client

The shell does **no business logic** — all command execution, agent management, and event streaming live in the daemon (v0.9.7). The shell is ~200 lines of REPL + rendering:

```
ta shell
   │
   ├── Connect to daemon (.ta/daemon.sock or localhost:7700)
   │
   ├── GET /api/status → render header (project, phase, agents)
   │
   ├── GET /api/events (SSE) → background thread renders notifications
   │
   └── REPL loop:
       │
       ├── Read input (rustyline)
       │
       ├── POST /api/input { "text": "<user input>" }
       │   (daemon routes: command → /api/cmd, else → /api/agent/ask)
       │
       └── Render response (stream agent SSE, or show command output)
```

This means:
- **One code path**: command routing, agent sessions, events — all in the daemon. Shell, web UI, Discord, Slack all use the same APIs.
- **Shell is trivially simple**: readline + HTTP client + SSE renderer.
- **No subprocess management in the shell**: daemon owns agent lifecycle.
- **Shell can reconnect**: if the shell crashes, `ta shell` reconnects to the existing daemon session (agent keeps running).

#### Items

1. **Shell REPL core**: `ta shell` command:
   - Auto-starts the daemon if not running (`ta daemon start` in background)
   - Connects via Unix socket (`.ta/daemon.sock`) — falls back to HTTP if socket not found
   - Prompt: `ta> ` (configurable in `.ta/shell.toml`)
   - All input sent to `POST /api/input` — daemon handles routing
   - History: rustyline with persistent history at `.ta/shell_history`
   - Tab completion: fetches routed prefixes and shortcuts from `GET /api/routes`

2. **Streaming agent responses**: When `/api/input` routes to the agent, the daemon returns an SSE stream. The shell renders chunks as they arrive (like a chat interface). Supports:
   - Partial line rendering (agent "typing" effect)
   - Markdown rendering (code blocks, headers, bold — via `termimad` or similar)
   - Interrupt: Ctrl+C cancels the current agent response

3. **Inline event notifications**: Background SSE connection to `GET /api/events`. Notifications rendered between the prompt and agent output:
   - `── 📋 Draft ready: "Fix auth" (view abc123) ──`
   - `── ✅ Goal completed: "Phase 1" (12m) ──`
   - `── ❌ Goal failed: "Phase 2" — timeout ──`
   - Non-disruptive: notifications don't break the current input line

4. **Session state header**: On startup and periodically, display:
   ```
   TrustedAutonomy v0.9.8 │ Next: v0.9.5.1 │ 2 drafts │ 1 agent running
   ```
   Updated when events arrive. Compact one-liner at top.

5. **`ta shell --init`**: Generate the default `.ta/shell.toml` routing config for customization.

6. **`ta shell --attach <session_id>`**: Attach to an existing daemon agent session (useful for reconnecting after a disconnect or switching between sessions).

#### Completed

- [x] Shell REPL core: `ta shell` command with rustyline, persistent history at `~/.ta/shell_history`, `ta> ` prompt
- [x] Input routing through `POST /api/input` — daemon handles command vs agent dispatch
- [x] Tab completion from `GET /api/routes` (shortcuts + built-in shell commands)
- [x] Status header on startup from `GET /api/status` — project, version, next phase, drafts, agents
- [x] Background SSE event listener (`GET /api/events`) rendering inline notifications
- [x] `ta shell --init` generates default `.ta/shell.toml` routing config
- [x] `ta shell --attach <session_id>` attaches to existing daemon agent session
- [x] `ta shell --url <url>` for custom daemon URL override
- [x] Built-in shell commands: help, :status, exit/quit/:q
- [x] Default routing config template (`apps/ta-cli/templates/shell.toml`)
- [x] 8 tests (SSE rendering, completions, config init, daemon URL resolution)

#### Deferred items resolved
- Unix domain socket connection → v0.11.4 (MCP Transport Abstraction)
- Auto-start daemon → completed in v0.10.16
- Streaming agent response rendering → completed in v0.10.12 (streaming Q&A)
- Ctrl+C interrupt → completed in v0.10.14 (Ctrl-C detach)
- Non-disruptive event notifications → completed in v0.10.11 (TUI auto-tail + notifications)
- Periodic status header refresh → completed in v0.10.12 (status bar enhancements)

#### Implementation scope
- `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/shell.rs` — REPL core (~200 lines), daemon client, SSE rendering
- `apps/ta-cli/Cargo.toml` — add `rustyline`, `reqwest` (HTTP client), `tokio-stream` (SSE)
- `apps/ta-cli/templates/shell.toml` — default routing config
- `docs/USAGE.md` — `ta shell` documentation

#### Why so simple?
All complexity lives in the daemon (v0.9.7). The shell is deliberately thin — just a rendering layer. This means any bug fix or feature in the daemon benefits all interfaces (shell, web, Discord, Slack, email) simultaneously.

#### Why not enhance `ta dev`?
`ta dev` gives the agent the terminal (agent drives, human reviews elsewhere). `ta shell` gives the human the terminal (human drives, agent assists). Both connect to the same daemon. `ta dev` is for autonomous work; `ta shell` is for interactive exploration and management.

#### Version: `0.9.8-alpha`

### v0.9.8.1 — Auto-Approval, Lifecycle Hygiene & Operational Polish
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Three themes that make TA reliable for sustained multi-phase use:
- **(A) Policy-driven auto-approval**: Wire the policy engine into draft review so drafts matching configurable conditions are auto-approved — preserving full audit trail and the ability to tighten rules at any time.
- **(B) Goal lifecycle & GC**: Unified `ta gc`, goal history ledger, `ta goal list --active` filtering, and event store pruning (items 9–10).
- **(C) Operational observability**: Actionable error messages, timeout diagnostics, daemon version detection, status line accuracy (items 9, plus CLAUDE.md observability mandate).

```

#### Items

1. **`AutoApproveDraftConfig` struct**: Add to `PolicyDocument` under `auto_approve.drafts`:
   - `enabled: bool` (master switch, default false)
   - `auto_apply: bool` (also apply after approve)
   - `git_commit: bool` (create commit if auto-applying)
   - `conditions: AutoApproveConditions` (size limits, path rules, verification, phase limits)

2. **`should_auto_approve_draft()` function**: Core evaluation logic in `ta-policy`:
   - Takes `&DraftPackage` + `&PolicyDocument` + optional `&AgentProfile`
   - Returns `AutoApproveDecision`:
     - `Approved { reasons: Vec<String> }` — all conditions met, with audit trail of why
     - `Denied { blockers: Vec<String> }` — which conditions failed, included in review request
   - Condition evaluation order: enabled check → size limits → path rules → phase limits → agent trust level. Short-circuits on first failure.

3. **Path matching**: Glob-based matching against `Artifact.resource_uri`:
   - `allowed_paths`: if set, ALL changed files must match at least one pattern
   - `blocked_paths`: if ANY changed file matches, auto-approval is denied (overrides allowed_paths)
   - Uses the existing `glob` crate pattern matching

4. **Verification integration**: Optionally run test/lint commands before auto-approving:
   - `require_tests_pass: true` → runs configured `test_command` in the staging workspace
   - `require_clean_clippy: true` → runs configured `lint_command`
   - Both default to false (verification adds latency; opt-in only)
   - Verification runs in the staging directory, not the source — safe even if tests have side effects
   - Timeout: configurable, default 5 minutes

5. **Gateway/daemon wiring**: In the draft submit handler:
   - Before routing to ReviewChannel, call `should_auto_approve_draft()`
   - If approved: set `DraftStatus::Approved { approved_by: "policy:auto", approved_at }`, dispatch `DraftAutoApproved` event
   - If denied: include blockers in the `InteractionRequest` so the human knows why they're being asked
   - If `auto_apply` enabled: immediately call the apply logic (copy staging → source, optional git commit)

6. **`DraftAutoApproved` event**: New `TaEvent` variant:
   ```rust
   DraftAutoApproved {
       draft_id: String,
       goal_run_id: Uuid,
       reasons: Vec<String>,       // "all files in tests/**, 3 files, 45 lines"
       auto_applied: bool,
       timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
   }
   ```

7. **Audit trail**: Auto-approved drafts are fully audited:
   - Audit entry includes: which conditions were evaluated, which matched, policy document version
   - `approved_by: "policy:auto"` distinguishes from human approvals
   - `ta audit verify` includes auto-approved drafts in the tamper-evident chain

8. **`ta policy check <draft_id>`**: CLI command to dry-run the auto-approval evaluation:
   ```
   $ ta policy check abc123
   Draft: abc123 — "Add unit tests for auth module"

   Auto-approval evaluation:
     ✅ enabled: true
     ✅ max_files: 3 ≤ 5
     ✅ max_lines_changed: 87 ≤ 200
     ✅ all paths match allowed_paths:
        tests/auth_test.rs → tests/**
        tests/fixtures/auth.json → tests/**
        tests/README.md → *.md
     ✅ no blocked paths matched
     ⏭️  require_tests_pass: skipped (not enabled)
     ✅ phase "tests" in allowed_phases

   Result: WOULD AUTO-APPROVE
   ```

9. **Status line: distinguish active vs tracked agents/goals**: The daemon `/api/status` endpoint currently counts all `GoalRun` entries with state `running` or `pr_ready`, including stale historical goals with no live process. This inflates the agent/goal count shown in `ta shell` and the Console. Fix:
   - Add `active_agents` (goals with a live process or updated within the last hour) vs `total_tracked` (all non-terminal goals) to the status response
   - Shell status line shows only active: `2 agents running` not `26 agents`
   - `ta status --all` shows the full breakdown including stale entries
   - Detection heuristic: if `updated_at` is older than `idle_timeout_secs` (from daemon config, default 30 min) and state is `running`, classify as stale

10. **Goal lifecycle GC & history ledger**: Enhance `ta goal gc` and `ta draft gc` into a unified `ta gc` with a persistent history ledger so archived goals remain queryable.
    - **Goal history ledger** (`.ta/goal-history.jsonl`): When GC archives or removes a goal, append a compact summary line:
      ```jsonl
      {"id":"ca306e4d","title":"Implement v0.9.8.1","state":"applied","phase":"v0.9.8.1","agent":"claude-code","created":"2026-03-06","completed":"2026-03-06","duration_mins":42,"draft_id":"abc123","artifact_count":15,"lines_changed":487}
      ```
    - **`ta gc`** — unified top-level command that runs both goal GC and draft GC in one pass:
      - Transitions stale `running` goals to `failed` (existing behavior)
      - Also handles `pr_ready` goals older than threshold (draft built but never reviewed)
      - Writes history summary before archiving/removing goal JSON files
      - Removes staging directories for all terminal goals
      - Cleans orphaned draft package JSON files
      - Flags: `--dry-run`, `--threshold-days N` (default 7), `--all` (ignore threshold, GC everything terminal), `--archive` (move to `.ta/goals/archive/` instead of deleting)
      - Prints disk usage summary: "Reclaimed 93 GB across 56 staging directories"
    - **`ta goal history`** — read and render the history ledger:
      - Default: compact table of recent goals (last 20)
      - `--phase v0.9.8.1` — filter by plan phase
      - `--since 2026-03-01` — filter by date
      - `--agent claude-code` — filter by agent
      - `--json` — raw JSONL output for scripting
    - **`ta goal list --active`** — filter to non-terminal goals only (default behavior change: `ta goal list` shows only active, `ta goal list --all` shows everything including terminal)
    - **Event store pruning**: `ta gc` also prunes events linked to archived goals from the daemon's event store, preventing stale event replay

#### Security Model

- **Default: off** — auto-approval must be explicitly enabled. Fresh `ta init` projects start with `drafts.enabled: false`.
- **Tighten only**: `PolicyCascade` merges layers with "most restrictive wins". A constitution or agent profile can tighten but never loosen project-level rules.
- **Blocked paths override allowed paths**: A file matching `blocked_paths` forces human review even if it also matches `allowed_paths`.
- **Audit everything**: Auto-approved drafts have the same audit trail as human-approved ones. `ta audit log` shows them with `policy:auto` attribution.
- **Escape hatch**: `ta draft submit --require-review` forces human review regardless of auto-approval config. The agent cannot bypass this flag (it's a CLI flag, not an MCP parameter).

### v0.9.8.1.1 — Unified Allow/Deny List Pattern
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Standardize all allowlist/blocklist patterns across TA to support both allow and deny lists with consistent semantics: deny takes precedence over allow, empty allow = allow all, empty deny = deny nothing.

#### Problem
TA has multiple places that use allowlists or blocklists, each with slightly different semantics:
- **Daemon command routing** (`config.rs`): `commands.allowed` only — no deny list
- **Auto-approval paths** (`policy.yaml`): `allowed_paths` + `blocked_paths` (deny wins)
- **Agent tool access**: implicit per-mode (full/plan/review-only) — no configurable lists
- **Channel reviewer access**: `allowed_roles` / `allowed_users` — no deny
- **Sandbox command allowlist** (`ta-sandbox`): allow-only

These should share a common pattern.

#### Design

```rust
/// Reusable allow/deny filter. Deny always takes precedence.
pub struct AccessFilter {
    pub allowed: Vec<String>,   // glob patterns; empty = allow all
    pub denied: Vec<String>,    // glob patterns; empty = deny nothing
}

impl AccessFilter {
    /// Returns true if the input is permitted.
    /// Logic: if denied matches → false (always wins)
    ///        if allowed is empty → true (allow all)
    ///        if allowed matches → true
    ///        else → false
    pub fn permits(&self, input: &str) -> bool;
}
```

#### Items

1. **`AccessFilter` struct** in `ta-policy`: reusable allow/deny with glob matching and `permits()` method
2. **Daemon command config**: Replace `commands.allowed: Vec<String>` with `commands: AccessFilter` (add `denied` field). Default: `allowed: ["*"]`, `denied: []`
3. **Auto-approval paths**: Refactor `allowed_paths` / `blocked_paths` to use `AccessFilter` internally (keep YAML field names for backward compat)
4. **Channel access control**: Add `denied_roles` / `denied_users` alongside existing `allowed_*` fields
5. **Sandbox commands**: Add `denied` list to complement existing allowlist
6. **Agent tool access**: Add configurable tool allow/deny per agent config in `agents/*.yaml`
7. **Documentation**: Explain the unified pattern in USAGE.md — one mental model for all access control

#### Implementation scope
- `crates/ta-policy/src/access_filter.rs` — `AccessFilter` struct, glob matching, tests (~100 lines)
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/config.rs` — migrate `CommandConfig.allowed` to `AccessFilter`
- `crates/ta-policy/src/auto_approve.rs` — use `AccessFilter` for path matching
- `crates/ta-sandbox/src/lib.rs` — use `AccessFilter` for command lists
- Backward-compatible: existing configs with only `allowed` still work (empty `denied` = deny nothing)
- Tests: deny-wins-over-allow, empty-allow-means-all, glob matching, backward compat

#### Completed

- [x] `AccessFilter` struct in `ta-policy/src/access_filter.rs` with `permits()`, `tighten()`, `from_allowed()`, `allow_all()`, `is_unrestricted()`, `Display` impl, serde support, and 18 tests
- [x] Daemon `CommandConfig`: added `denied` field alongside `allowed`, `access_filter()` method returning `AccessFilter`, updated `cmd.rs` to use `filter.permits()` instead of `is_command_allowed()` (2 new tests)
- [x] Auto-approval paths: refactored `should_auto_approve_draft()` to use `AccessFilter` for path matching, `merge_conditions()` to use `AccessFilter::tighten()` (backward compatible — existing YAML field names preserved)
- [x] Sandbox: added `denied_commands` field to `SandboxConfig`, deny check in `execute()` and `is_allowed()` (2 new tests)
- [x] Documentation: unified access control pattern in USAGE.md

#### Deferred items resolved
- Channel access control → completed in v0.10.16
- Agent tool access → completed in v0.10.16

### v0.9.8.2 — Pluggable Workflow Engine & Framework Integration
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Add a `WorkflowEngine` trait to TA core so multi-stage, multi-role, multi-framework workflows can be orchestrated with pluggable engines — built-in YAML for simple cases, framework adapters (LangGraph, CrewAI) for power users, or custom implementations.

#### Design Principle: TA Mediates, Doesn't Mandate

TA defines *what* decisions need to be made (next stage? route back? what context?). The engine decides *how*. Users who already have LangGraph or CrewAI use TA for governance only. Users with simple agent setups (Claude Code, Codex) use TA's built-in YAML engine.

```
TA Core (always present):

Configuration:
```yaml
# .ta/config.yaml
workflow:
  engine: yaml                    # built-in (default)
  # engine: langraph             # delegate to LangGraph adapter
  # engine: crewai               # delegate to CrewAI adapter
  # engine: process              # user-supplied binary (JSON-over-stdio)
  #   command: "./my-workflow-engine"
  # engine: none                 # no workflow — manage goals manually
```

#### Items

1. **`WorkflowEngine` trait** (`crates/ta-workflow/src/lib.rs`): Core abstraction that all engines implement.
   ```rust
   pub trait WorkflowEngine: Send + Sync {
       fn start(&self, def: &WorkflowDefinition) -> Result<WorkflowId>;
       fn stage_completed(&self, id: WorkflowId, stage: &str,
                          verdicts: &[Verdict]) -> Result<StageAction>;
       fn status(&self, id: WorkflowId) -> Result<WorkflowStatus>;
       fn inject_feedback(&self, id: WorkflowId, stage: &str,
                          feedback: FeedbackContext) -> Result<()>;
   }

   pub enum StageAction {
       Proceed { next_stage: String, context: GoalContext },
       RouteBack { target_stage: String, feedback: FeedbackContext,
                   severity: Severity },
       Complete,
       AwaitHuman { request: InteractionRequest },
   }
   ```

2. **`WorkflowDefinition` schema** (`crates/ta-workflow/src/definition.rs`): Declarative workflow structure used by all engines.
   ```rust
   pub struct WorkflowDefinition {
       pub name: String,
       pub stages: Vec<StageDefinition>,
       pub roles: HashMap<String, RoleDefinition>,
   }

   pub struct StageDefinition {
       pub name: String,
       pub depends_on: Vec<String>,
       pub roles: Vec<String>,           // parallel roles within stage
       pub then: Vec<String>,            // sequential roles after parallel
       pub review: Option<StageReview>,
       pub on_fail: Option<FailureRouting>,
   }

   pub struct RoleDefinition {
       pub agent: String,                // agent config name
       pub constitution: Option<String>, // constitution YAML path
       pub prompt: String,               // system prompt for this role
       pub framework: Option<String>,    // override framework for this role
   }
   ```

3. **`Verdict` schema and feedback scoring** (`crates/ta-workflow/src/verdict.rs`):
   - `Verdict { role, decision: Pass|Fail|Conditional, severity, findings: Vec<Finding> }`
   - `Finding { title, description, severity: Critical|Major|Minor, category }`
   - **Feedback scoring agent**: When verdicts arrive, optionally pass them to a scoring agent (metacritic pattern). The scoring agent's system prompt is a template — users customize the rubric. The scorer produces:
     - Aggregate score (0.0–1.0)
     - Severity classification (critical/major/minor)
     - Routing recommendation (which stage to route back to, if any)
     - Synthesized feedback for the next iteration
   - Scoring agent config in workflow YAML:
     ```yaml
     verdict:
       scorer:
         agent: claude-code
         prompt: |
           You are a metacritic reviewer. Given multiple review verdicts,
           synthesize them into an aggregate assessment. Weight security
           findings 2x. Classify overall severity and recommend routing.
       pass_threshold: 0.7
       required_pass: [security-reviewer]
     ```

4. **GoalRun extensions**: Add workflow context fields to `GoalRun`:
   - `workflow_id: Option<String>` — links goal to a workflow instance
   - `stage: Option<String>` — which stage this goal belongs to
   - `role: Option<String>` — which role this goal fulfills
   - `context_from: Vec<Uuid>` — goals whose output feeds into this one's context
   - These are metadata only — no behavioral change if unset. All existing goals continue to work as-is.

5. **Goal chaining** (context propagation): When a stage completes and the next stage starts, automatically inject the previous stage's output as context:
   - Previous stage's draft summary → next stage's system prompt
   - Previous stage's verdict findings → next stage's feedback section (on route-back)
   - Uses the existing CLAUDE.md injection mechanism (same as `ta run` context injection)
   - `context_from` field on GoalRun tracks the provenance chain

6. **Built-in YAML workflow engine** (`crates/ta-workflow/src/yaml_engine.rs`):
   - Parses `.ta/workflows/*.yaml` files
   - Evaluates stage dependencies (topological sort)
   - Starts goals for each role in a stage (parallel or sequential per config)
   - Collects verdicts, runs scorer, decides routing
   - Handles retry limits and loop detection (`max_retries` per routing rule)
   - ~400 lines — deliberately simple. Power users use LangGraph.

7. **Process-based workflow plugin** (`crates/ta-workflow/src/process_engine.rs`):
   - Same JSON-over-stdio pattern as channel plugins (v0.10.2)
   - TA spawns the engine process, sends `WorkflowDefinition` + events via stdin
   - Engine responds with `StageAction` decisions via stdout
   - This is how LangGraph/CrewAI adapters connect
   - ~150 lines in TA core

8. **`ta_workflow` MCP tool**: For orchestrator agents to interact with workflows:
   - `action: "start"` — start a workflow from a definition file
   - `action: "status"` — get workflow status (current stage, verdicts, retry count)
   - `action: "list"` — list active and completed workflows
   - No goal_run_id required (orchestrator-level tool, uses v0.9.6 optional ID pattern)

9. **`ta workflow` CLI commands**:
   - `ta workflow start <definition.yaml>` — start a workflow
   - `ta workflow status [workflow_id]` — show status
   - `ta workflow list` — list workflows
   - `ta workflow cancel <workflow_id>` — cancel an active workflow
   - `ta workflow history <workflow_id>` — show stage transitions, verdicts, routing decisions

10. **Framework integration templates** (shipped with TA):
    - `templates/workflows/milestone-review.yaml` — the full plan/build/review workflow using built-in YAML engine
    - `templates/workflows/roles/` — role definition library (planner, designer, PM, engineer, security-reviewer, customer personas)
    - `templates/workflows/adapters/langraph_adapter.py` — Python bridge: LangGraph ↔ TA's WorkflowEngine protocol
    - `templates/workflows/adapters/crewai_adapter.py` — Python bridge: CrewAI ↔ TA's protocol
    - `templates/workflows/simple-review.yaml` — minimal 2-stage workflow (build → review) for getting started
    - `templates/workflows/security-audit.yaml` — security-focused workflow with OWASP reviewer + dependency scanner

#### Workflow Events
```rust
// New TaEvent variants
WorkflowStarted { workflow_id, name, stage_count, timestamp }
StageStarted { workflow_id, stage, roles: Vec<String>, timestamp }
StageCompleted { workflow_id, stage, verdicts: Vec<Verdict>, timestamp }
WorkflowRouted { workflow_id, from_stage, to_stage, severity, reason, timestamp }
VerdictScored { workflow_id, stage, aggregate_score, routing_recommendation, timestamp }
WorkflowCompleted { workflow_id, name, total_duration_secs, stages_executed, timestamp }
WorkflowFailed { workflow_id, name, reason, timestamp }
```

11. **Interactive workflow interaction from `ta shell`**: When a workflow reaches an `AwaitHuman` stage action, the shell renders it as an interactive prompt the human can respond to in real time.
    - **`await_human` per-stage config** in workflow YAML:
      ```yaml
      stages:
        - name: planning
          await_human: always     # always pause for human input before proceeding
        - name: build
          await_human: never      # fully automated
        - name: review
          await_human: on_fail    # pause only if verdicts fail the pass_threshold
      ```
      Values: `always` (pause after every stage completion), `never` (proceed automatically), `on_fail` (pause only when verdicts route back or score below threshold). Default: `never`.
    - **`InteractionRequest` struct** (part of `AwaitHuman` action):
      ```rust
      pub struct InteractionRequest {
          pub prompt: String,           // what the workflow is asking
          pub context: serde_json::Value, // stage verdicts, scores, findings
          pub options: Vec<String>,     // suggested choices (proceed, revise, cancel)
          pub timeout_secs: Option<u64>, // auto-proceed after timeout (None = wait forever)
      }
      ```
    - **Workflow interaction endpoint**: `POST /api/workflow/:id/input` — accepts `{ "decision": "proceed" | "revise" | "cancel", "feedback": "optional text" }`. The daemon routes the decision to the workflow engine's `inject_feedback()` method.
    - **Workflow event for shell rendering**: `WorkflowAwaitingHuman { workflow_id, stage, prompt, options, timestamp }` — SSE event that the shell listens for and renders as an interactive prompt with numbered options. The human types their choice, shell POSTs to the interaction endpoint.
    - **Shell-side UX**: When the shell receives a `workflow.awaiting_human` event, it renders:
      ```
      [workflow] Review stage paused — 2 findings need attention:
        1. Security: SQL injection risk in user input handler (critical)
        2. Style: Inconsistent error message format (minor)

      Options: [1] proceed  [2] revise planning  [3] cancel workflow
      workflow> _
      ```
      The `workflow>` prompt replaces the normal `ta>` prompt until the human responds. Normal shell commands still work (e.g., `ta draft view` to inspect the draft before deciding).

### v0.9.8.3 — Full TUI Shell (`ratatui`)
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Replace the line-mode rustyline shell with a full terminal UI modeled on Claude Code / claude-flow — persistent status bar, scrolling output, and input area, all in one screen.

#### Layout

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Items

1. **`ratatui` + `crossterm` terminal backend**: Full-screen TUI with three zones — output scroll area, input line, status bar. ~1500 lines replacing the current ~500-line rustyline shell.

2. **Status bar** (bottom): Project name, version, active agent count, pending draft count, daemon connection indicator (green dot = connected, red = disconnected), current workflow stage (if any). Updates live via SSE events.

3. **Input area** (above status bar): Text input with history (up/down arrows), tab-completion from `/api/routes`, multi-line support for longer commands. Uses `tui-textarea` or custom widget.

4. **Scrolling output pane** (main area): Command responses, SSE event notifications, workflow prompts. Auto-scrolls but allows scroll-back with PgUp/PgDn. Events are rendered inline with dimmed styling to distinguish from command output.

5. **Workflow interaction mode**: When a `workflow.awaiting_human` event arrives, the output pane shows the prompt/options and the input area switches to `workflow>` mode (from v0.9.8.2 item 11). Normal commands still work during workflow prompts.

6. **Split pane support** (stretch): Optional vertical split showing agent session output on one side, shell commands on the other. Toggle with `Ctrl-W`. Useful when monitoring an agent in real time while reviewing drafts.

7. **Notification badges**: Unread event count shown in status bar. Cleared when user scrolls to bottom. Draft-ready events flash briefly.

#### Completed
- ✅ `ratatui` + `crossterm` terminal backend — full-screen TUI with three zones (output scroll, input line, status bar)
- ✅ Status bar — project name, version, agent count, draft count, daemon connection indicator, workflow stage, unread badge
- ✅ Input area — text input with cursor movement, history (up/down), tab-completion, Ctrl-A/E/U/K editing shortcuts
- ✅ Scrolling output pane — command responses and SSE events with styled lines, PgUp/PgDn scroll, auto-scroll with unread counter
- ✅ Workflow interaction mode — `workflow>` prompt when `workflow_awaiting_human` events arrive
- ✅ Notification badges — unread event count in status bar, cleared on scroll-to-bottom
- ✅ `--classic` flag preserves rustyline shell as fallback
- ✅ 13 unit tests — input handling, cursor movement, history navigation, tab completion, scroll, daemon state, workflow mode

#### Deferred items resolved
- Split pane support → completed in v0.10.14

#### Implementation scope
- `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/shell_tui.rs` — new TUI module with ratatui (~500 lines + tests)
- `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/shell.rs` — updated to dispatch TUI vs classic, shared functions made pub(crate)
- `apps/ta-cli/Cargo.toml` — added `ratatui`, `crossterm` dependencies
- Daemon API layer unchanged — same HTTP/SSE endpoints

#### Version: `0.9.8-alpha.3`

---

### v0.9.8.4 — VCS Adapter Abstraction & Plugin Architecture
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Move all version control operations behind the `SubmitAdapter` trait so TA is fully VCS-agnostic. Add adapter-contributed exclude patterns for staging, implement stub adapters for SVN and Perforce, and design the external plugin loading mechanism.

#### Problem
Today, raw `git` commands leak outside the `SubmitAdapter` trait boundary — branch save/restore in `draft.rs`, VCS auto-detection, `.git/` exclusions hardcoded in `overlay.rs`, and git hash embedding in `build.rs`. This means adding Perforce or SVN support requires modifying core TA code in multiple places rather than simply providing a new adapter.

Additionally, shipping adapters for every VCS/email/database system inside the core `ta` binary doesn't scale. External teams (e.g., a Perforce shop or a custom VCS vendor) should be able to publish a TA adapter as an independent installable package.

#### Design

##### 1. Adapter-contributed exclude patterns
Each `SubmitAdapter` provides a list of directory/file patterns that should be excluded when copying source to staging. This replaces the hardcoded `.git/` exclusion in `overlay.rs`.

```rust
pub trait SubmitAdapter: Send + Sync {
    // ... existing methods ...

    /// Patterns to exclude from staging copy (VCS metadata dirs, etc.)
    /// Returns patterns in .taignore format: "dirname/", "*.ext", "name"
    fn exclude_patterns(&self) -> Vec<String> {
        vec![]
    }

    /// Save/restore working state around apply operations.
    /// Git: save current branch, restore after commit.
    /// Perforce: save current changelist context.
    /// Default: no-op.
    fn save_state(&self) -> Result<Option<Box<dyn std::any::Any + Send>>> { Ok(None) }
    fn restore_state(&self, state: Option<Box<dyn std::any::Any + Send>>) -> Result<()> { Ok(()) }

    /// Auto-detect whether this adapter applies to the given project root.
    /// Git: checks for .git/ directory
    /// Perforce: checks for P4CONFIG or .p4config
    fn detect(project_root: &Path) -> bool where Self: Sized { false }
}
```

- `GitAdapter::exclude_patterns()` → `[".git/"]`
- `SvnAdapter::exclude_patterns()` → `[".svn/"]`
- `PerforceAdapter::exclude_patterns()` → `[".p4config"]` (P4 doesn't have a metadata dir per se)
- `overlay.rs` merges adapter excludes with `.taignore` user patterns and built-in defaults (`target/`, `node_modules/`, etc.)

##### 2. Move git-specific code behind the adapter

| Current location | What it does | Where it moves |
|---|---|---|
| `draft.rs:1946-2048` | Branch save/restore around apply | `SubmitAdapter::save_state()` / `restore_state()` |
| `draft.rs:1932` | `.git/` existence check for auto-detect | `SubmitAdapter::detect()` + adapter registry |
| `overlay.rs:24` | Hardcoded `"target/"` + `.git/` exclusion | Adapter `exclude_patterns()` + `ExcludePatterns::merge()` |
| `build.rs` | `git rev-parse HEAD` for version hash | `SubmitAdapter::revision_id()` or build-time env var |
| `shell.rs` | `git status` as shell route | Adapter-provided shell routes (optional) |

##### 3. Stub adapters (untested)

**SVN adapter** (`crates/ta-submit/src/svn.rs`):
- `prepare()` → no-op (SVN doesn't use branches the same way)
- `commit()` → `svn add` + `svn commit`
- `push()` → no-op (SVN commit is already remote)
- `open_review()` → no-op (SVN doesn't have built-in review)
- `exclude_patterns()` → `[".svn/"]`
- `detect()` → check for `.svn/` directory
- **Note: untested — contributed by AI, needs validation by an SVN user**

**Perforce adapter** (`crates/ta-submit/src/perforce.rs`):
- `prepare()` → `p4 change -o | p4 change -i` (create pending changelist)
- `commit()` → `p4 reconcile` + `p4 shelve`
- `push()` → `p4 submit`
- `open_review()` → `p4 shelve` + Swarm API (if configured)
- `exclude_patterns()` → `[".p4config", ".p4ignore"]`
- `detect()` → check for `P4CONFIG` env var or `.p4config`
- `save_state()` → record current client/changelist
- `restore_state()` → revert to saved client state
- **Note: untested — contributed by AI, needs validation by a Perforce user**

##### 4. Adapter auto-detection registry

```rust
/// Registry of available adapters with auto-detection.
pub fn detect_adapter(project_root: &Path) -> Box<dyn SubmitAdapter> {
    // Check configured adapter first (workflow.toml)
    // Then auto-detect: try each registered adapter's detect()
    // Fallback: NoneAdapter
}
```

Order: Git → SVN → Perforce → None. First match wins. User can override with `workflow.toml` setting `submit.adapter = "perforce"`.

##### 5. External plugin architecture (design only — implementation deferred)

External adapters loaded as separate executables that communicate via a simple JSON-over-stdio protocol, similar to how `ta run` launches agents:

```
~/.ta/plugins/
  ta-submit-perforce    # executable
  ta-submit-jira        # executable
  ta-submit-plastic     # executable (Plastic SCM)
```

**Protocol**: TA spawns the plugin binary and sends JSON commands on stdin, reads JSON responses from stdout:
```json
// → plugin
{"method": "exclude_patterns", "params": {}}
// ← plugin
{"result": [".plastic/", ".plastic4.selector"]}

// → plugin
{"method": "commit", "params": {"goal_id": "abc", "message": "Fix bug", "files": ["src/main.rs"]}}
// ← plugin
{"result": {"commit_id": "cs:1234", "message": "Changeset 1234 created"}}
```

**Discovery**: `ta plugin install <name>` downloads from a registry (crates.io, npm, or TA's own) and places the binary in `~/.ta/plugins/`. Or manual: just drop an executable named `ta-submit-<name>` in the plugins dir.

**Config**: `submit.adapter = "perforce"` → TA first checks built-in adapters, then looks for `~/.ta/plugins/ta-submit-perforce`.

This pattern extends beyond VCS to any adapter type:
- `ta-channel-slack` — Slack notification channel
- `ta-channel-discord` — Discord notification channel
- `ta-channel-email` — Email notification channel
- `ta-output-jira` — Jira ticket creation from drafts
- `ta-store-postgres` — PostgreSQL-backed goal/draft store

### v0.9.9 — Conversational Project Bootstrapping (`ta new`) *(design only)*
<!-- status: deferred -->
**Status note**: Sub-phases v0.9.9.1–v0.9.9.5 are all **done** — they built the infrastructure (interactive mode, plan-from-doc, channel delivery, authoring tooling). However, the **parent `ta new` CLI command itself was never implemented**. The end-to-end bootstrapping flow described below doesn't exist yet. Implementation moved to **v0.10.17**.

**Goal**: Start a new project from any interface by describing what you want in natural language. A planner agent generates the project structure and PLAN.md through conversation, then initializes the TA workspace.

#### User Flow (from any interface)

```
You:  I want to build a Rust CLI that manages Cloudflare DNS
      records with policy controls, audit logging, and a web
      dashboard for reviewing changes.

Agent: I'll help you plan this. A few questions:

      1. Multi-account support? (manage DNS for several
         Cloudflare accounts)
      2. Should it also support Route53 or other providers,
         or Cloudflare-only?
      3. How strict should policy be — allowlist of editable
         records, or more granular (per-type, per-zone)?

You:  Multi-account yes. Cloudflare-only for now but design
      for multiple providers later. Policy should be per-zone
      and per-record-type.

Agent: Here's a proposed plan:

      **dns-guardian** — Cloudflare DNS governance CLI

      Phase 1: Project Scaffold
        Cargo workspace, CI, README, license, .ta/ init

      Phase 2: Provider Abstraction & Cloudflare Client
        DnsProvider trait, Cloudflare implementation,
        account selection, auth (API token per account)

      Phase 3: DNS Record Operations
        List/create/update/delete, import existing records,
        dry-run mode, diff preview before apply

      Phase 4: Policy Engine
        Per-zone record-type allowlist, approval required
        for wildcard/MX changes, policy config in YAML

      Phase 5: Audit Logging
        Change log (who/what/when/why), export JSON/CSV,
        tamper-evident chain (reuse ta-audit)

      Phase 6: Web Dashboard
        Record browser, change history, pending approvals,
        served by embedded HTTP server

      Phase 7: Tests & Documentation
        Integration tests with API mock, user guide

      Want to adjust anything before I generate the project?

You:  Add a health check phase — periodic DNS resolution
      validation with alerting.

Agent: Added Phase 6.5: DNS Health Monitor (periodic
      resolution checks, configurable alerts, health
      dashboard widget). Dashboard moved to Phase 7.

      Generating project now...

      ✅ Created /projects/dns-guardian
      ✅ Initialized .ta/ workspace
      ✅ Generated PLAN.md (8 phases, 34 items)
      ✅ Created Cargo.toml workspace scaffold
      ✅ Created .ta/policy.yaml (default: checkpoint)

      Ready to start Phase 1?

You:  Yes

Agent: [starts goal for Phase 1]
      🚀 Goal started: "Phase 1: Project Scaffold"
```

          │
          └── Hand off to normal TA workflow
              (project exists, can run goals)
```

#### Items

1. **`ta new` CLI command**: Starts a conversational project bootstrapping session.
   - `ta new` — interactive mode, asks questions
   - `ta new --from <brief.md>` — seed from a written description file
   - `ta new --template <name>` — start from a project template (v0.7.3 templates)
   - Creates a temporary working directory for the planner agent
   - On completion, moves the generated project to the target directory

2. **Planner agent mode**: A specialized agent configuration (`agents/planner.yaml`) that:
   - Has access to `ta init`, filesystem write, and plan generation tools
   - Does NOT have access to `ta goal start`, `ta draft build`, or other runtime tools (it's creating the project, not executing goals)
   - System prompt includes: plan format specification (PLAN.md with `<!-- status: pending -->` markers), versioning policy, phase sizing guidelines
   - Conversation is multi-turn: agent asks clarifying questions, proposes a plan, user refines, agent generates
   - Agent tools available:
     - `ta_scaffold` — create directory structure, Cargo.toml/package.json/etc.
     - `ta_plan_generate` — write PLAN.md from structured plan data
     - `ta_init` — initialize .ta/ workspace in the new project
     - `ta_config_write` — write initial .ta/policy.yaml, .ta/config.yaml, agents/*.yaml

3. **Plan generation from conversation**: The planner agent converts the conversation into a structured PLAN.md:
   - Each phase has: title, goal description, numbered items, implementation scope, version
   - Phase sizing: guide the agent to create phases that are 1-4 hours of work each
   - Dependencies: note which phases depend on others
   - Phase markers: all start as `<!-- status: pending -->`
   - Versioning: auto-assign version numbers (v0.1.0 for phase 1, v0.2.0 for phase 2, etc.)

4. **Project template integration**: Leverage v0.7.3 templates as starting points:
   - `ta new --template rust-cli` → Cargo workspace, clap, CI, README
   - `ta new --template rust-lib` → Library crate, docs, benchmarks
   - `ta new --template ts-api` → Node.js, Express/Fastify, TypeScript
   - Templates provide the scaffold; the planner agent customizes and adds the PLAN.md
   - Custom templates: `ta new --template ./my-template` or `ta new --template gh:org/repo`

5. **Daemon API endpoint** (`POST /api/project/new`): Start a bootstrapping session via the daemon API, so Discord/Slack/email interfaces can create projects too.
   - First request starts the planner agent session
   - Subsequent requests in the same session continue the conversation
   - Final response includes the project path and PLAN.md summary
   ```json
   // Start
   { "description": "Rust CLI for Cloudflare DNS management with policy controls" }
   → { "session_id": "plan-abc", "response": "I'll help you plan this. A few questions..." }

   // Continue
   { "session_id": "plan-abc", "prompt": "Multi-account, Cloudflare only for now" }
   → { "session_id": "plan-abc", "response": "Here's a proposed plan..." }

   // Generate
   { "session_id": "plan-abc", "prompt": "Looks good, generate it" }
   → { "session_id": "plan-abc", "project_path": "/projects/dns-guardian", "phases": 8 }
   ```

6. **Post-creation handoff**: After the project is generated:
   - Print summary: phase count, item count, estimated version range
   - Offer to start the first goal: "Ready to start Phase 1? (y/n)"
   - If using `ta shell`, switch the shell's working directory to the new project
   - If using a remote interface, return the project path and next steps

### v0.9.9.1 — Interactive Mode Core Plumbing
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Add the foundational infrastructure for agent-initiated mid-goal conversations with humans. Interactive mode is the general primitive — micro-iteration within the macro-iteration TA governs. The agent calls `ta_ask_human` (MCP tool), TA delivers the question through whatever channel the human is on, and routes the response back. The agent continues.

#### Architecture

```
Agent calls ta_ask_human("What database?")
  → MCP tool writes question to .ta/interactions/pending/<id>.json
  → Emits SessionEvent::AgentNeedsInput
  → GoalRunState transitions Running → AwaitingInput
  → Tool polls for .ta/interactions/answers/<id>.json

Human sees question in ta shell / Slack / web UI
  → Responds via POST /api/interactions/:id/respond
  → HTTP handler writes answer file
  → MCP tool poll finds it, returns answer to agent
  → GoalRunState transitions AwaitingInput → Running
```

#### Items

1. ~~**`ta_ask_human` MCP tool** (`crates/ta-mcp-gateway/src/tools/human.rs`)~~ ✅
   - Parameters: `question`, `context`, `response_hint` (freeform/yes_no/choice), `choices`, `timeout_secs`
   - File-based signaling: writes question file, polls for answer file (1s interval)
   - Emits `AgentNeedsInput` and `AgentQuestionAnswered` events
   - Timeout returns actionable message (not error) so agent can continue

2. ~~**`QuestionRegistry`** (`crates/ta-daemon/src/question_registry.rs`)~~ ✅
   - In-memory coordination for future in-process use (oneshot channels)
   - `PendingQuestion`, `HumanAnswer` types
   - `register()`, `answer()`, `list_pending()`, `cancel()`

3. ~~**HTTP response endpoints** (`crates/ta-daemon/src/api/interactions.rs`)~~ ✅
   - `POST /api/interactions/:id/respond` — writes answer file + fires registry
   - `GET /api/interactions/pending` — lists pending questions

4. ~~**`GoalRunState::AwaitingInput`** (`crates/ta-goal/src/goal_run.rs`)~~ ✅
   - New state with `interaction_id` and `question_preview`
   - Valid transitions: `Running → AwaitingInput → Running`, `AwaitingInput → PrReady`
   - Visible in `ta goal list` and external UIs

5. ~~**New `SessionEvent` variants** (`crates/ta-events/src/schema.rs`)~~ ✅
   - `AgentNeedsInput` — with `suggested_actions()` returning a "respond" action
   - `AgentQuestionAnswered`, `InteractiveSessionStarted`, `InteractiveSessionCompleted`

6. ~~**`InteractionKind::AgentQuestion`** (`crates/ta-changeset/src/interaction.rs`)~~ ✅
   - New variant for channel rendering dispatch

7. ~~**`ConversationStore`** (`crates/ta-goal/src/conversation.rs`)~~ ✅
   - JSONL log at `.ta/conversations/<goal_id>.jsonl`
   - `append_question()`, `append_answer()`, `load()`, `next_turn()`, `conversation_so_far()`

#### Version: `0.9.9-alpha.1`

---

### v0.9.9.2 — Shell TUI Interactive Mode
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Wire interactive mode into `ta shell` so humans can see agent questions and respond inline. This is the first user-facing surface for interactive mode.

#### Items

1. **SSE listener for `agent_needs_input`** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/shell_tui.rs`):
   - SSE event handler recognizes `agent_needs_input` event → sends `TuiMessage::AgentQuestion`
   - Question text displayed prominently in the output pane

2. **Input routing switch** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/shell_tui.rs`):
   - `App` gets `pending_question: Option<PendingQuestion>` field
   - When `pending_question` is `Some`, prompt changes to `[agent Q1] >`
   - Enter sends text to `POST /api/interactions/:id/respond` instead of `/api/input`
   - On success, clears `pending_question`, restores normal prompt

3. **`ta run --interactive` flag** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/run.rs`):
   - Wire `--interactive` flag through to enable `ta_ask_human` in the MCP tool set
   - When set, agent system prompt includes instructions about `ta_ask_human` availability

4. **`ta conversation <goal_id>` CLI command** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/conversation.rs`):
   - Print conversation history from JSONL log
   - Show turn numbers, roles, timestamps

#### Completed

- ✅ SSE listener for `agent_needs_input` — `parse_agent_question()`, `TuiMessage::AgentQuestion` variant (5 tests)
- ✅ Input routing switch — `pending_question` field, prompt changes to `[agent Q1] >`, routes Enter to `/api/interactions/:id/respond` (3 tests)
- ✅ `ta run --interactive` flag — `build_interactive_section()` injects `ta_ask_human` documentation into CLAUDE.md (2 tests)
- ✅ `ta conversation <goal_id>` CLI command — reads JSONL log, formatted + JSON output modes (4 tests)
- ✅ Classic shell SSE rendering for `agent_needs_input` and `agent_question_answered` events
- ✅ Status bar indicator for pending agent questions
- ✅ Version bump to `0.9.9-alpha.2`

#### Version: `0.9.9-alpha.2`

---

### v0.9.9.3 — `ta plan from <doc>` Wrapper
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Build a convenience wrapper that uses interactive mode to generate a PLAN.md from a product document. The agent reads the document, asks clarifying questions via `ta_ask_human`, proposes phases, and outputs a plan draft.

#### Completed

- ✅ `PlanCommands::From` variant — `ta plan from <path>` reads document, builds planning prompt, delegates to `ta run --interactive` (4 tests)
- ✅ `build_planning_prompt()` — constructs agent prompt with document content, PLAN.md format guide, and `ta_ask_human` usage instructions; truncates docs >100K chars
- ✅ `agents/planner.yaml` — planner agent configuration with fs read/write access, no shell/network, planning-oriented alignment
- ✅ `docs/USAGE.md` updates — `ta plan from` documentation with examples, comparison table for `--detect` vs `plan from` vs `plan create`
- ✅ Fuzzy document search — `find_document()` searches workspace root, `docs/`, `spec/`, `design/`, `rfcs/`, and subdirs so bare filenames resolve automatically (4 tests)
- ✅ Shell/daemon integration — `ta plan from *` added to default `long_running` patterns in daemon config for background execution
- ✅ Validation — rejects missing files, empty documents, directories; observability-compliant error messages with search location details
- ✅ Version bump to `0.9.9-alpha.3`

#### When to use `--detect` vs `plan from`
- **`ta init --detect`** — detects project *type* for config scaffolding. Fast, deterministic, no AI.
- **`ta plan from <doc>`** — reads a product document and generates a phased *development plan* via interactive agent session. Use after `ta init`.
- **`ta plan create`** — generates a generic plan from a hardcoded template. Use when you don't have a product doc.

#### Version: `0.9.9-alpha.3`

---

### v0.9.9.4 — External Channel Delivery
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Enable interactive mode questions to flow through external channels (Slack, Discord, email) — not just `ta shell`. The `QuestionRegistry` + HTTP endpoint design is already channel-agnostic; this phase adds the delivery adapters.

#### Completed

- ✅ `ChannelDelivery` trait in `ta-events::channel` — async trait with `deliver_question()`, `name()`, `validate()` methods; `ChannelQuestion`, `DeliveryResult`, `ChannelRouting` types (5 tests)
- ✅ `channels` routing field on `AgentNeedsInput` event — backward-compatible `#[serde(default)]` Vec<String> for channel routing hints
- ✅ `ta-connector-slack` crate — `SlackAdapter` implementing `ChannelDelivery`, posts Block Kit messages with action buttons for yes/no and choice responses, thread-reply prompts for freeform (7 tests)
- ✅ `ta-connector-discord` crate — `DiscordAdapter` implementing `ChannelDelivery`, posts embeds with button components (up to 5 per row), footer prompts for freeform (6 tests)
- ✅ `ta-connector-email` crate — `EmailAdapter` implementing `ChannelDelivery`, sends HTML+text emails via configurable HTTP endpoint, includes interaction metadata headers (7 tests)
- ✅ `ChannelDispatcher` in `ta-daemon` — routes questions to registered adapters based on channel hints or daemon defaults; `from_config()` factory for building from `daemon.toml` (9 tests)
- ✅ `ChannelsConfig` in daemon config — `[channels]` section in `daemon.toml` with `default_channels`, `[channels.slack]`, `[channels.discord]`, `[channels.email]` sub-tables
- ✅ Version bump to `0.9.9-alpha.4`

#### Deferred items moved
- Slack/Discord/Email interaction handler webhooks → v0.11.0 (Event-Driven Agent Routing)

#### Version: `0.9.9-alpha.4`

---

### v0.9.9.5 — Workflow & Agent Authoring Tooling
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Make it easy for users to create, validate, and iterate on custom workflow definitions and agent profiles without reading Rust source code or guessing YAML schema.

#### Problem
Today, creating a custom workflow or agent config requires copying an existing file and modifying it by trial and error. There's no scaffolding command, no schema validation beyond serde parse errors, and no way to check for common mistakes (undefined role references, unreachable stages, missing agent configs). USAGE.md now has authoring guides (added in v0.9.9.1), but tooling support is missing.

#### Items

1. **`ta workflow new <name>`** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/workflow.rs`):
   - Generates `.ta/workflows/<name>.yaml` with annotated comments explaining every field
   - Includes a 2-stage build→review template as a starting point
   - Prints the file path and suggests next steps

2. **`ta workflow validate <path>`** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/workflow.rs`):
   - Schema validation: all required fields present, correct types
   - Reference validation: every role referenced in a stage exists in `roles:`
   - Dependency validation: no cycles, no references to undefined stages
   - Agent validation: every `roles.*.agent` has a matching agent config file
   - Prints actionable errors with line numbers and suggestions

3. **`ta agent new <name>`** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/agent.rs` or `setup.rs`):
   - Generates `.ta/agents/<name>.yaml` with annotated comments
   - Prompts for agent type (full developer, read-only auditor, orchestrator)
   - Fills in appropriate `alignment` defaults based on type

4. **`ta agent validate <path>`** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/agent.rs`):
   - Schema validation for agent config YAML
   - Checks `command` exists on PATH
   - Warns on common misconfigurations (e.g., `injects_settings: true` without `injects_context_file: true`)

5. **Example library** (`templates/workflows/`, `templates/agents/`):
   - 3-4 workflow examples: code-review, deploy-pipeline, security-audit, milestone-review
   - 3-4 agent examples: developer, auditor, planner, orchestrator
   - `ta workflow list --templates` and `ta agent list --templates` to browse

6. **Planner workflow role** — built-in `planner` role for workflow definitions:
   - Uses `agents/planner.yaml` (shipped in v0.9.9.3) as the agent config
   - Enables Plan→Implement→Review→Plan loops in multi-stage workflows
   - Example workflow: `plan-implement-review.yaml` with planner→engineer→reviewer stages
   - The planner stage can receive a document path or objective as input
   - Integrates with `ta plan from` — workflows can invoke planning as a stage

7. **Versioning schema templates** (`templates/version-schemas/`):
   - Pre-built version schema configs users can adopt or customize:
     - `semver.yaml` — standard semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH with pre-release)
     - `calver.yaml` — calendar versioning (YYYY.MM.PATCH)
     - `sprint.yaml` — sprint-based versioning (sprint-N.iteration)
     - `milestone.yaml` — milestone-based (v1, v2, v3 with sub-phases)
   - `ta plan create --version-schema semver` selects a template
   - Schema defines: version format regex, bump rules, phase-to-version mapping
   - Users can write custom schemas in `.ta/version-schema.yaml`

#### Completed
- [x] `ta workflow new <name>` with annotated scaffold and `--from` template selection
- [x] `ta workflow validate <path>` with schema, reference, dependency, and agent config validation
- [x] `ta agent new <name>` with `--type` (developer, auditor, orchestrator, planner) and alignment defaults
- [x] `ta agent validate <path>` with schema validation and PATH checking
- [x] Example library: 5 workflow templates, 6 role templates, 4 agent templates
- [x] `ta workflow list --templates` and `ta agent list --templates` browsing commands
- [x] Planner workflow role with `plan-implement-review.yaml` template
- [x] Versioning schema templates: semver, calver, sprint, milestone
- [x] Validation module in ta-workflow crate with 12 tests
- [x] Agent CLI command module with 10 tests
- [x] Workflow CLI new/validate commands with 7 tests

#### Deferred items moved
- `ta plan create --version-schema` → v0.10.17 (item 9)

#### Version: `0.9.9-alpha.5`

### v0.9.10 — Multi-Project Daemon & Office Configuration
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Extend the TA daemon to manage multiple projects simultaneously, with channel-to-project routing so a single Discord bot, Slack app, or email address can serve as the interface for several independent TA workspaces.

#### Problem
Today each `ta daemon` instance serves a single project. Users managing multiple projects need separate daemon instances and separate channel configurations. This makes it impossible to say "@ta inventory-service plan list" in a shared Discord channel — there's no way to route the message to the right project.

#### Architecture

```
                    ┌──────────────────────────────┐
  Discord/Slack/    │      Multi-Project Daemon     │
  Email/CLI ───────▶│                                │

```

Each `ProjectContext` holds:
- Workspace path + `.ta/` directory
- GoalRunStore, DraftStore, AuditLog
- PolicyDocument (per-project)
- ChannelRegistry (per-project, but channel listeners are shared)

#### Items

1. **`ProjectContext` struct**: Encapsulate per-project state (stores, policy, workspace path, plan). Refactor `GatewayState` to hold a `HashMap<String, ProjectContext>` instead of a single project context. Single-project mode (no `office.yaml`) remains the default — wraps current behavior in one `ProjectContext`.
2. **Office config schema**: Define `office.yaml` with `projects`, `channels.routes`, and `daemon` sections:
   ```yaml
   office:
     name: "My Dev Office"
     daemon:
       socket: ~/.ta/office.sock
       http_port: 3140
   projects:
     inventory-service:
       path: ~/dev/inventory-service
       plan: PLAN.md
       default_branch: main
     customer-portal:
       path: ~/dev/customer-portal
   channels:
     discord:
       token_env: TA_DISCORD_TOKEN
       routes:
         "#backend-reviews": { project: inventory-service, type: review }
         "#backend-chat":    { project: inventory-service, type: session }
         "#frontend-reviews": { project: customer-portal, type: review }
         "#office-status":   { type: notify, projects: all }
     email:
       routes:
         "backend@acme.dev":  { project: inventory-service, type: review }
         "frontend@acme.dev": { project: customer-portal, type: review }
   ```
3. **Message routing**: Implement channel → project resolution with precedence:
   - Dedicated channel route (from config)
   - Thread context (reply in a goal thread → same project)
   - Explicit prefix (`@ta <project-name> <command>`)
   - User's `default_project` setting
   - Ambiguous → ask user to clarify
4. **`ta office` CLI commands**:
   - `ta office start --config office.yaml` — start multi-project daemon
   - `ta office stop` — graceful shutdown (finish active goals)
   - `ta office status` — overview of projects, active goals, channel connections
   - `ta office status <project>` — per-project detail
   - `ta office project add/remove` — runtime project management
   - `ta office reload` — reload config without restart
5. **Daemon API expansion**: Extend daemon HTTP/socket API with project scoping:
   - All existing endpoints gain optional `?project=<name>` query parameter
   - `GET /api/projects` — list managed projects with status
   - `GET /api/projects/:name/status` — per-project detail
   - `POST /api/projects` — add project at runtime
   - `DELETE /api/projects/:name` — remove project
6. **Per-project overrides**: Support `.ta/office-override.yaml` in each project for project-specific policy or channel overrides that take precedence over the office config.
7. **Backward compatibility**: When no `office.yaml` exists, `ta daemon` works exactly as before (single project). The multi-project behavior is opt-in.

#### Implementation scope
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/project_context.rs` — `ProjectContext` struct with per-project stores (~150 lines)
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/office.rs` — office config parsing, project registry, lifecycle (~200 lines)
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/router.rs` — message routing with channel→project resolution (~150 lines)
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/web.rs` — project-scoped API endpoints (~100 lines)
- `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/office.rs` — `ta office` subcommands (~200 lines)
- `docs/USAGE.md` — multi-project setup guide, office.yaml reference
- Tests: project context isolation, routing precedence, runtime add/remove, backward compat with single-project mode

#### Completed

- [x] `ProjectContext` struct with per-project state encapsulation, path helpers, validation, status summary, per-project overrides from `.ta/office-override.yaml` (8 tests)
- [x] `OfficeConfig` schema parsing (`office.yaml`): office metadata, daemon settings, project entries, channel routing with route targets (7 tests)
- [x] `ProjectRegistry` runtime management: single-project and multi-project modes, add/remove at runtime, default project resolution, names listing
- [x] `MessageRouter` with 5-level precedence routing: dedicated channel route, thread context, explicit `@ta <project>` prefix, user default, ambiguous fallback (10 tests)
- [x] `ta office` CLI commands: start (foreground/background), stop (PID-based), status (overview + per-project detail), project add/remove/list, reload
- [x] Daemon API expansion: `GET /api/projects`, `GET /api/projects/:name`, `POST /api/projects`, `DELETE /api/projects/:name`, `POST /api/office/reload`
- [x] `AppState` extended with `ProjectRegistry`, `resolve_project_root()` for project-scoped queries
- [x] `--office-config` CLI flag and `TA_OFFICE_CONFIG` env var for multi-project daemon startup
- [x] Per-project overrides via `.ta/office-override.yaml` (security_level, default_agent, max_sessions, tags)
- [x] Backward compatibility: no `office.yaml` = single-project mode, all existing behavior preserved
- [x] Version bump to `0.9.10-alpha`

#### Deferred items moved
- Full GatewayState refactor → v0.10.18
- Thread context tracking → v0.10.18
- Config hot-reload → v0.10.18

### v0.10.0 — Gateway Channel Wiring & Multi-Channel Routing
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Wire `ChannelRegistry` into the MCP gateway so `.ta/config.yaml` actually controls which channels handle reviews, notifications, and escalations — and support routing a single event to multiple channels simultaneously.

#### Completed
- ✅ **Gateway `ChannelRegistry` integration**: `GatewayState::new()` loads `.ta/config.yaml`, builds `ChannelRegistry` via `default_registry()`, resolves `config.channels.review` → `ChannelFactory` → `ReviewChannel`. Replaced hardcoded `AutoApproveChannel` default. Falls back to `TerminalChannel` if config is missing or type is unknown.
- ✅ **Multi-channel routing**: `review` and `escalation` now accept either a single channel object or an array of channels (backward-compatible via `#[serde(untagged)]`). `notify` already supported arrays. Schema supports `strategy: first_response | quorum`.
- ✅ **`MultiReviewChannel` wrapper**: New `MultiReviewChannel` implementing `ReviewChannel` that dispatches to N inner channels. `request_interaction()` tries channels sequentially; first response wins (`first_response`) or collects N approvals (`quorum`). `notify()` fans out to all. 9 tests.
- ✅ **`ta config channels` command**: Shows resolved channel configuration — active channels, types, capabilities, and status. 3 tests.
- ✅ **Channel health check**: `ta config channels --check` verifies each configured channel is buildable (factory exists, config valid).

#### Implementation scope
- `crates/ta-mcp-gateway/src/server.rs` — registry loading, channel resolution
- `crates/ta-changeset/src/multi_channel.rs` — `MultiReviewChannel` wrapper (new)
- `crates/ta-changeset/src/channel_registry.rs` — `ReviewRouteConfig`, `EscalationRouteConfig` enums, `build_review_from_route()`, schema update
- `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/config.rs` — `ta config channels` command (new)
- `docs/USAGE.md` — multi-channel routing docs

#### Version: `0.10.0-alpha`

### v0.10.1 — Native Discord Channel
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: `DiscordChannelFactory` implementing `ChannelFactory` with direct Discord REST API connection, eliminating the need for the bridge service.

#### Completed
- ✅ **`ta-channel-discord` crate**: New crate at `crates/ta-channel-discord/` with `reqwest`-based Discord REST API integration (4 modules: lib, channel, factory, payload)
- ✅ **`DiscordReviewChannel`** implementing `ReviewChannel`: rich embeds with buttons, file-based response exchange, sync/async bridge
- ✅ **`DiscordChannelFactory`** implementing `ChannelFactory`: `channel_type()` → `"discord"`, config-driven build with `token_env`, `channel_id`, `response_dir`, `allowed_roles`, `allowed_users`, `timeout_secs`, `poll_interval_secs`
- ✅ **Access control**: `allowed_roles` and `allowed_users` restrict who can approve/deny
- ✅ **Payload builders**: Interaction-kind-aware embeds and buttons
- ✅ **Registry integration**: Registered in MCP gateway and CLI config
- ✅ **30 tests** across all modules

#### Deferred items moved
- Discord deny modal → v0.11.0 (Event-Driven Agent Routing — interactive channel responses)
- Discord thread-based discussions → v0.11.0

#### Config
```yaml
channels:
  review:
    type: discord
    token_env: TA_DISCORD_TOKEN
    channel_id: "123456789"
    allowed_roles: ["reviewer"]
    allowed_users: ["user#1234"]
```

#### Plugin-readiness note

This is built as an in-process Rust crate (the existing pattern). When v0.10.2 (Channel Plugin Loading) lands, this adapter should be refactorable to an external plugin — it already implements `ChannelDelivery` and uses only HTTP/WebSocket. Design the crate so its core logic (message formatting, button handling, webhook response parsing) is separable from the in-process trait impl. This makes it a reference implementation for community plugins in other languages.

#### Version: `0.10.1-alpha`

### v0.10.2 — Channel Plugin Loading (Multi-Language)
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Allow third-party channel plugins without modifying TA source or writing Rust, enabling community-built integrations (Teams, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, etc.) in any language.

#### Current State

The `ChannelDelivery` trait is a clean boundary — it depends only on serializable types from `ta-events`, and the response path is already HTTP (`POST /api/interactions/:id/respond`). But registration is hardcoded: adding a channel requires a new Rust crate in `crates/ta-connectors/`, a dependency in `daemon/Cargo.toml`, and a match arm in `channel_dispatcher.rs`. Users cannot add channels without recompiling TA.

#### Design

Two out-of-process plugin protocols. Both deliver `ChannelQuestion` as JSON and receive answers through the existing HTTP response endpoint. Plugins can be written in any language.

**Protocol 1: JSON-over-stdio (subprocess)**

TA spawns the plugin executable, sends `ChannelQuestion` JSON on stdin, reads a `DeliveryResult` JSON line from stdout. The plugin delivers the question however it wants (API call, email, push notification). When the human responds, the plugin (or the external service's webhook) POSTs to `/api/interactions/:id/respond`.

```
TA daemon
  → spawns: python3 ta-channel-teams.py
  → stdin:  {"interaction_id":"...","question":"What database?","choices":["Postgres","MySQL"],...}
  → stdout: {"channel":"teams","delivery_id":"msg-123","success":true}
  ...later...
  → Teams webhook → POST /api/interactions/:id/respond → answer flows back to agent
```

**Protocol 2: HTTP callback**

TA POSTs `ChannelQuestion` to a configured URL. The external service delivers it and POSTs the response back to `/api/interactions/:id/respond`. No subprocess needed — works with any HTTP-capable service, cloud function, or webhook relay.

```toml
[[channels.external]]
name = "pagerduty"
protocol = "http"
deliver_url = "https://my-service.com/ta/deliver"
auth_token_env = "TA_PAGERDUTY_TOKEN"
```

**Both protocols use the same JSON schema** — `ChannelQuestion` and `DeliveryResult` from `ta-events`. The subprocess just reads/writes them over stdio; the HTTP variant sends/receives them as request/response bodies.

#### Items

1. **`ExternalChannelAdapter`** (`crates/ta-daemon/src/channel_dispatcher.rs`):
   - Implements `ChannelDelivery` by delegating to subprocess or HTTP
   - Subprocess variant: spawn process, write JSON to stdin, read JSON from stdout
   - HTTP variant: POST question JSON to configured URL, parse response
   - Both variants: answers return via existing `/api/interactions/:id/respond`

2. **Plugin manifest** (`channel.toml`):
   ```toml
   name = "teams"
   version = "0.1.0"
   command = "python3 ta-channel-teams.py"  # or any executable
   protocol = "json-stdio"                   # or "http"
   deliver_url = ""                          # only for http protocol
   capabilities = ["deliver_question"]
   ```

3. **Plugin discovery**: Scan `~/.config/ta/plugins/channels/` and `.ta/plugins/channels/` for `channel.toml` manifests. Register each as an `ExternalChannelAdapter` in the `ChannelDispatcher`.

4. **Open `daemon.toml` config** — `[[channels.external]]` array replaces closed-world `ChannelsConfig`:
   ```toml
   [[channels.external]]
   name = "teams"
   command = "ta-channel-teams"
   protocol = "json-stdio"

   [[channels.external]]
   name = "custom-webhook"
   protocol = "http"
   deliver_url = "https://my-service.com/ta/deliver"
   auth_token_env = "TA_CUSTOM_TOKEN"
   ```

5. **`ta plugin list`**: Show installed channel plugins with protocol, capabilities, and validation status.

6. **`ta plugin install <path-or-url>`**: Copy executable + manifest to plugin directory.

7. **Plugin SDK examples** — starter templates in multiple languages:
   - `templates/channel-plugins/python/` — Python channel plugin skeleton
   - `templates/channel-plugins/node/` — Node.js channel plugin skeleton
   - `templates/channel-plugins/go/` — Go channel plugin skeleton
   - Each includes: JSON schema types, stdin/stdout handling, example delivery logic

#### Multi-language plugin example (Python)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""TA channel plugin for Microsoft Teams — reads JSON from stdin, posts to Teams."""
import json, sys, requests

def main():
    question = json.loads(sys.stdin.readline())
    # Post to Teams webhook
    resp = requests.post(TEAMS_WEBHOOK, json={
        "type": "message",
        "attachments": [{
            "content": {
                "type": "AdaptiveCard",
                "body": [{"type": "TextBlock", "text": question["question"]}],
                "actions": [{"type": "Action.OpenUrl",
                             "title": "Respond",
                             "url": f"{question['callback_url']}/api/interactions/{question['interaction_id']}/respond"}]
            }
        }]
    })
    print(json.dumps({"channel": "teams", "delivery_id": resp.headers.get("x-msg-id", ""), "success": resp.ok}))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Prep: Built-in channels should follow the same pattern

Slack (v0.10.3) and email (v0.10.4) are built as external plugins from the start. Discord (v0.10.1) was built as an in-process crate — it should be refactorable to an external plugin once the plugin system is proven. The long-term goal: TA ships with zero built-in channel adapters; all channels are plugins. The built-in ones are just pre-installed defaults.

#### Completed
- ✅ `PluginManifest` struct with TOML parsing, validation, protocol enum (JsonStdio, Http)
- ✅ Plugin discovery: scans `.ta/plugins/channels/` (project) and `~/.config/ta/plugins/channels/` (global) for `channel.toml` manifests
- ✅ `ExternalChannelAdapter` implementing `ChannelDelivery` for both protocols:
  - JSON-over-stdio: spawn process, write question JSON to stdin, read result from stdout
  - HTTP callback: POST question JSON to configured URL, parse response
  - Comprehensive error handling with actionable messages and timeout support
- ✅ `[[channels.external]]` config in `daemon.toml` for inline plugin registration
- ✅ `ChannelDispatcher::from_config_with_plugins()` — loads inline config + discovered plugins
- ✅ `ta plugin list` — show installed plugins with protocol, capabilities, validation status
- ✅ `ta plugin install <path>` — copy plugin to project or global directory
- ✅ `ta plugin validate` — check commands exist on PATH, URLs are well-formed
- ✅ Plugin SDK templates: Python, Node.js, Go skeletons in `templates/channel-plugins/`
- ✅ 29 tests: manifest parsing, discovery, installation, stdio/HTTP delivery, error paths, validation

#### Deferred items resolved
- Plugin version checking → completed in v0.10.16
- Plugin marketplace / remote install → backlog (no target phase yet)

#### Version: `0.10.2-alpha`

### v0.10.2.1 — Refactor Discord Channel to External Plugin
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Extract the in-process `ta-channel-discord` crate into an external plugin using the v0.10.2 plugin system. Validates the plugin architecture with a real, tested adapter and establishes the migration pattern for any future in-process-to-plugin conversions.

#### Approach

The Discord adapter already implements `ChannelDelivery` and uses only HTTP (no daemon internals). The refactoring separates the core logic (message formatting, embed building, button handling) from the in-process trait impl, then wraps it in a standalone binary that speaks JSON-over-stdio.

#### Completed
1. [x] Extract core Discord logic (payload builders, embed formatting) into `plugins/ta-channel-discord/src/payload.rs`
2. [x] Create standalone binary (`plugins/ta-channel-discord/src/main.rs`) that reads `ChannelQuestion` from stdin, calls Discord REST API, writes `DeliveryResult` to stdout — 13 tests
3. [x] Add `channel.toml` manifest for plugin discovery
4. [x] Remove `ta-channel-discord` crate from workspace — Discord becomes a pre-installed plugin, not a compiled-in dependency
5. [x] Update `ChannelDispatcher` registration to load Discord via plugin system instead of hardcoded match arm — daemon now emits migration warning for old `[channels.discord]` config
6. [x] Migrate Discord config from in-process `ChannelsConfig` to `[[channels.external]]` in `daemon.toml` — old config produces deprecation warning
7. [x] Verify all workspace tests pass (existing Discord connector tests in ta-connector-discord still pass; plugin has its own 13 tests)
8. [x] Update docs: discord-channel guide rewritten for plugin architecture

#### Version: `0.10.2-alpha.1`

---

### v0.10.2.2 — `ta plugin build` Command
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Add a CLI command to build plugin binaries from source, removing the manual `cd && cargo build && cp` workflow.

#### Usage
```bash
# Build a specific plugin
ta plugin build discord

# Build multiple plugins
ta plugin build discord,slack,email

# Build all plugins found in plugins/
ta plugin build --all
```

#### Behavior
1. Discover plugin source directories under `plugins/ta-channel-<name>/`
2. Run `cargo build --release` in each plugin directory
3. Copy the compiled binary + `channel.toml` to `.ta/plugins/channels/<name>/`
4. Print summary: which plugins built, binary size, install path

#### Completed
1. [x] `PluginCommands::Build` variant in `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/plugin.rs` with `names: Vec<String>` and `--all` flag
2. [x] Plugin source discovery: scan `plugins/` directory for `Cargo.toml` + `channel.toml` pairs
3. [x] Build runner: invoke `cargo build --release` in plugin directory, capture output, report errors
4. [x] Install step: copy binary + manifest to `.ta/plugins/channels/<name>/`
5. [x] `--all` flag: discover and build every plugin in `plugins/`
6. [x] Output: progress per plugin, success/failure summary, binary paths
7. [x] Error handling: continue building remaining plugins if one fails, report all failures at end
8. [x] 13 new tests: discovery, binary name extraction, name resolution, error paths, formatting

#### Version: `0.10.2-alpha.2`

---

### v0.10.3 — Slack Channel Plugin
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Slack channel plugin built on the v0.10.2 plugin system — validates that the plugin loading infrastructure works end-to-end with a real service.

#### Approach

Built as an external plugin (JSON-over-stdio or standalone Rust binary), not an in-process crate. Uses Slack Block Kit for rich review messages and Socket Mode for outbound-only connectivity.

#### Completed
1. ✅ **Plugin binary** (`plugins/ta-channel-slack/`): Reads `ChannelQuestion` JSON from stdin, posts Block Kit message with Approve/Deny buttons to Slack via `chat.postMessage`, writes `DeliveryResult` to stdout — 17 tests
2. ✅ **Thread-based detail**: Posts context as thread reply when context exceeds 500 chars (best-effort, non-blocking)
3. ✅ **`channel.toml` manifest**: Plugin discovery via standard plugin loading (v0.10.2)
4. ✅ **Block Kit payloads**: Header, question section, context section, interactive buttons (yes/no, choice, freeform), interaction ID footer
5. ✅ **Actionable error messages**: Missing token, missing channel ID, Slack API errors with permission hints
6. ✅ **`allowed_users` env var**: `TA_SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS` documented for access control integration

#### Deferred items moved
- Slack Socket Mode + deny modal + HTTP mode → v0.11.0 (Event-Driven Agent Routing — interactive channel responses)

#### Config
```toml
[[channels.external]]
name = "slack"
command = "ta-channel-slack"
protocol = "json-stdio"

# Plugin reads these env vars directly
# TA_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN, TA_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID
# TA_SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS (optional, comma-separated user IDs)
```

#### Version: `0.10.3-alpha`

---

### v0.10.4 — Email Channel Plugin
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Email channel plugin built on the v0.10.2 plugin system — demonstrates the plugin model works for async, non-real-time channels.

#### Approach

Built as an external plugin. Sends formatted review emails via SMTP, polls IMAP for reply-based approval. Email is inherently slower than chat — validates that the plugin/interaction model handles longer response times gracefully.

#### Completed
- ✅ Plugin binary (`plugins/ta-channel-email/`): standalone Rust binary using JSON-over-stdio protocol, reads `ChannelQuestion` from stdin, sends via SMTP (lettre), writes `DeliveryResult` to stdout
- ✅ Subject tagging: configurable prefix (default `[TA Review]`) with `X-TA-Request-ID`, `X-TA-Interaction-ID`, `X-TA-Goal-ID` headers for threading
- ✅ Reply parsing module: strips quoted text (`>` lines, `On ... wrote:` blocks, signatures, mobile footers), recognizes APPROVE/DENY/YES/NO/LGTM/REJECT keywords — supports English, French, German attribution patterns
- ✅ Multiple reviewers: comma-separated `TA_EMAIL_REVIEWER` list, all receive the email (first to reply wins)
- ✅ App Password support: STARTTLS SMTP with username/password auth (works with Gmail App Passwords, no OAuth)
- ✅ Email threading: Message-ID based on interaction_id, follow-up turns use In-Reply-To/References headers
- ✅ HTML + plain text multipart emails with structured layout, interactive guidance per question type
- ✅ `channel.toml` manifest for standard plugin discovery (v0.10.2)
- ✅ HTML body escapes user content to prevent XSS
- ✅ 36 tests: email body builders (16), reply parsing (15), serialization/config (5)

#### Deferred items moved
- IMAP reply polling + configurable timeout → v0.11.0 (Event-Driven Agent Routing)
- Plugin version checking → completed in v0.10.16

#### Config
```toml
[[channels.external]]
name = "email"
command = "ta-channel-email"
protocol = "json-stdio"

# Plugin reads these env vars directly
# TA_EMAIL_SMTP_HOST, TA_EMAIL_SMTP_PORT (default: 587)
# TA_EMAIL_USER, TA_EMAIL_PASSWORD
# TA_EMAIL_REVIEWER (comma-separated)
# TA_EMAIL_FROM_NAME (default: "TA Agent")
# TA_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX (default: "[TA Review]")
```

#### Version: `0.10.4-alpha`

---

### v0.10.5 — External Workflow & Agent Definitions
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Allow workflow definitions and agent configurations to be pulled from external sources (registries, git repos, URLs) so teams and third-party authors can publish reusable configurations. Include an automated release process with press-release generation.

#### Problem
Today, workflow YAML files and agent configs (`agents/*.yaml`) live only in the project's `.ta/` directory. There's no mechanism to:
- Share a workflow across multiple projects
- Publish an agent configuration for others to use (e.g., "security-reviewer" agent with specialized system prompt)
- Pull in community-authored configurations
- Generate release communications automatically as part of `ta release`

Builds on v0.9.9.5 (local authoring tooling: `ta workflow new`, `ta workflow validate`, `ta agent new`, `ta agent validate`) by adding the external distribution layer.

#### Design

##### 1. External workflow/agent sources
```bash
# Pull a workflow from a registry
ta workflow add security-review --from registry:trustedautonomy/workflows
ta workflow add deploy-pipeline --from gh:myorg/ta-workflows

# Pull an agent config
ta agent add security-reviewer --from registry:trustedautonomy/agents
ta agent add code-auditor --from https://example.com/ta-agents/auditor.yaml

# List installed external configs
ta workflow list --source external
ta agent list --source external
```

##### 2. Workflow/agent package format
```yaml
# workflow-package.yaml (published to registry)
name: security-review
version: 1.0.0
author: trustedautonomy
description: "Multi-step security review workflow with SAST, dependency audit, and manual sign-off"
ta_version: ">=0.9.8"
files:
  - workflows/security-review.yaml
  - agents/security-reviewer.yaml
  - policies/security-baseline.yaml
```

##### 3. Release press-release generation
The `ta release` process includes an optional press-release authoring step where an agent generates a release announcement from the changelog, guided by a user-provided sample:

```bash
# Configure a sample press release as the style template
ta release config set press_release_template ./samples/sample-press-release.md

# During release, the agent generates a press release matching the sample's style
ta release run --press-release

# The user can update the prompt to refine the output
ta release run --press-release --prompt "Focus on the workflow engine and VCS adapter features"
```

The agent reads the changelog/release notes, follows the style and tone of the sample document, and produces a draft press release that goes through the normal TA review process (draft → approve → apply).

##### 4. Workflow authoring and publishing
```bash
# Author a new workflow
ta workflow new deploy-pipeline
# Edit .ta/workflows/deploy-pipeline.yaml

# Publish to registry
ta workflow publish deploy-pipeline --registry trustedautonomy

# Version management
ta workflow publish deploy-pipeline --bump minor
```

#### Completed
1. [x] External source resolver: registry, GitHub repo, and raw URL fetching for YAML configs
2. [x] `ta workflow add/remove/list` commands with `--from` source parameter
3. [x] `ta agent add/remove/list` commands with `--from` source parameter
4. [x] Workflow/agent package manifest format (`workflow-package.yaml`)
5. [x] Local cache for external configs (`~/.ta/cache/workflows/`, `~/.ta/cache/agents/`)
6. [x] Version pinning and update checking for external configs
7. [x] `ta release` press-release generation step with sample-based style matching
8. [x] Press release template configuration (`ta release config set press_release_template`)
9. [x] `ta workflow publish` command for authoring and publishing to registry
10. [x] Documentation: authoring guide for workflow/agent packages
11. [x] **Multi-language plugin builds**: Add `build_command` field to `channel.toml` so `ta plugin build` works with non-Rust plugins (Python, Go, Node). Rust plugins default to `cargo build --release`; others specify their own build step (e.g., `go build -o ta-channel-teams .`, `pip install -e .`). Extend v0.10.2.2's build runner to read and execute `build_command`.

#### Version: `0.10.5-alpha`

### v0.10.6 — Release Process Hardening & Interactive Release Flow
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix release process issues, harden the `ta release run` pipeline, and make releases an interactive-mode workflow so the human never leaves `ta shell`.

#### Known Bugs
- ~~**Releases always marked pre-release**: `release.yml` auto-detected `alpha`/`beta` in the version string and set `prerelease: true`, which meant GitHub never updated "latest release". Fixed in v0.9.9.1 — default is now latest, with explicit `--prerelease` input on `workflow_dispatch`.~~ ✅
- **`ta_fs_write` forbidden in orchestrator mode**: The release notes agent tries to write `.release-draft.md` directly but is blocked by orchestrator policy. The agent should either use `ta_goal` to delegate the write, or the orchestrator policy should whitelist release artifact writes. Filed as bug — the process should just work without the agent needing workarounds.
- **Release notes agent workaround**: Currently the agent works around the `ta_fs_write` restriction by using alternative write methods, but this is fragile and shouldn't be necessary.

#### Interactive Release Flow

Today `ta release run` runs synchronously in the foreground — the human must exit the agent, review notes externally, then re-run. The release should be a background goal that uses interactive mode for human review checkpoints:

```
ta shell> release v0.10.6
  → TA launches release agent as background goal
  → Agent generates changelog, release notes draft
  → Agent calls ta_ask_human: "Draft release notes below. Any changes?"
  → Human reviews in ta shell, responds with feedback
  → Agent revises, calls ta_ask_human: "Updated. Ready to publish?"
  → Human: "yes"
  → Agent bumps version, tags, pushes — GH Actions takes over
  → TA emits release_completed event
  → Shell shows: "Release v0.10.6 published. View: https://github.com/..."
```

The human stays in `ta shell` throughout. Release notes go through the standard draft review flow. Interactive mode (v0.9.9.1–v0.9.9.2) provides the `ta_ask_human` infrastructure.

#### Completed
1. [x] Fix `ta_fs_write` permission in orchestrator mode for release artifact files (`.release-draft.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) — added `ORCHESTRATOR_WRITE_WHITELIST` to `CallerMode` and updated `handle_fs_write` to check path before blocking
2. [x] Add orchestrator-mode write whitelist for release-specific file patterns — `is_write_whitelisted()` method on `CallerMode` matches filenames against `.release-draft.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `version.json`, `.press-release-draft.md`
3. [x] End-to-end test for `ta release run` pipeline without manual intervention — `e2e_pipeline_no_manual_gates` test with marker file verification
4. [x] Release dry-run mode: `ta release run --dry-run` validates all steps without publishing — existing `--dry-run` flag + new `ta release validate` command for pre-flight checks (version format, git state, tag availability, pipeline config, toolchain)
5. [x] **Background goal launch from shell**: `release` shortcut in shell config expands to `ta release run`, long-running command classification ensures background execution via daemon
6. [x] **Interactive release agent**: `ta release run --interactive` launches the `releaser` agent with `ta_ask_human`-based review checkpoints
7. [x] **`agents/releaser.yaml`**: Release agent config with `ta_ask_human` enabled, write access scoped to release artifacts via orchestrator whitelist
8. [x] **Release workflow definition**: `templates/workflows/release.yaml` — 4-stage workflow (validate → generate-notes → build-verify → publish) with human review at notes and publish stages

#### Deferred items moved
- Wire `ta sync`/`ta build` in release → v0.10.18 (depends on v0.11.1, v0.11.2)

#### Version: `0.10.6-alpha`

---

### v0.10.7 — Documentation Review & Consolidation
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Full documentation audit and refinement pass after the v0.10.x feature set is complete. Ensure all docs are accurate, consistent, and organized for both users and integration developers.

#### Scope
- **USAGE.md**: Verify all commands, flags, and config options are documented. Remove stale references. Ensure progressive disclosure (getting started → daily use → advanced). Add examples for every config section.
- **MISSION-AND-SCOPE.md**: Confirm feature boundary decisions match implementation. Update protocol tables if anything changed. Validate the scope test against actual shipped features.
- **CLAUDE.md**: Trim to essentials. Remove references to completed phases. Ensure build/verify instructions are current.
- **PLAN.md**: Archive completed phases into a collapsed section or separate `docs/PLAN-ARCHIVE.md`. Keep active phases clean.
- **README.md**: Update for current state — accurate feature list, installation instructions, quick-start guide.
- **ADRs** (`docs/adr/`): Ensure all significant decisions have ADRs. Check that existing ADRs aren't contradicted by later work.
- **Plugin/integration docs**: Verify JSON schema examples match actual types. Add end-to-end plugin authoring guide if missing.
- **Cross-doc consistency**: Terminology (draft, goal, artifact, staging), config field names, version references.

#### Completed
1. [x] Audit USAGE.md against current CLI `--help` output for every subcommand — verified all 25 subcommands documented, added missing `accept-terms`/`view-terms`/`terms-status` commands, updated version to v0.10.7-alpha
2. [x] Audit MISSION-AND-SCOPE.md protocol/auth tables against actual implementation — protocol table verified accurate, updated `ta schema export` reference to note it's still planned
3. [x] Review and update README.md for current feature set and installation — updated version badges, current status, project structure, MCP tools table, and "What's Implemented" section
4. [x] Archive completed PLAN.md phases (pre-v0.9) into `docs/PLAN-ARCHIVE.md` — moved ~2000 lines (Phase 0 through v0.8.2) to `docs/PLAN-ARCHIVE.md`, replaced with collapsed reference
5. [x] Verify all config examples in docs parse correctly against current schema — reviewed workflow.toml, config.yaml, policy.yaml, daemon.toml, office.yaml, and channel.toml against codebase structs
6. [x] Cross-reference ADRs with implementation — updated ADR-modular-decomposition status to "Deferred", updated ADR-product-concept-model crate map to reflect current implementation status
7. [x] Add plugin authoring quickstart guide (`docs/PLUGIN-AUTHORING.md`) with end-to-end example — created comprehensive guide with Python and Rust examples, JSON schemas, manifest format, and testing instructions
8. [x] Terminology consistency pass across all docs — verified Draft/PR terminology, staging/virtual-workspace usage, version references updated across USAGE.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md

#### Version: `0.10.7-alpha`

---

### v0.10.8 — Pre-Draft Verification Gate
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Run configurable build/lint/test checks after the agent exits but before the draft is created. Catches CI failures locally so broken drafts never reach review.

#### Problem
Today `ta run` builds a draft as soon as the agent exits — even if the agent left broken code. The user reviews, approves, applies, pushes, and CI fails. That's a wasted cycle. If TA runs the same checks CI would run *before* creating the draft, failures are caught immediately.

#### Design
A `[verify]` section in `.ta/workflow.toml` defines commands to run in the staging directory after the agent exits. If any command fails, the draft is not created — the agent can be re-entered (`ta run --follow-up`) to fix the issue.

```toml
[verify]
# Commands run in staging dir after agent exits, before draft build.
# All must pass (exit 0) for the draft to be created.
commands = [
    "cargo build --workspace",
    "cargo test --workspace",
    "cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings",
    "cargo fmt --all -- --check",
]

# On failure: "block" (no draft, default), "warn" (create draft with warning), "agent" (re-launch agent with error context)
on_failure = "block"

# Timeout per command in seconds (default: 300)
timeout = 300
```

#### Behavior
1. Agent exits normally
2. TA runs each verify command sequentially in the staging directory
3. **All pass**: Draft is built as normal
4. **Any fail** (`on_failure = "block"`): No draft created. Print which command failed with output. Suggest `ta run --follow-up` to fix.
5. **Any fail** (`on_failure = "warn"`): Draft is created with a verification warning visible in `ta draft view`
6. **Any fail** (`on_failure = "agent"`): Re-launch the agent with the failure output injected as context (uses interactive mode if available)

#### Completed
1. ✅ `VerifyConfig` struct in `crates/ta-submit/src/config.rs`: `commands`, `on_failure` (enum: Block/Warn/Agent), `timeout` with serde defaults
2. ✅ `run_verification()` in `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/verify.rs`: runs commands sequentially with per-command timeout, captures output, returns `VerificationResult`
3. ✅ Wire into `ta run` flow: verification runs after agent exit + file restoration, before `ta draft build`
4. ✅ Block mode: aborts draft creation on failure, prints failed commands with output, suggests `ta run --follow-up` and `ta verify`
5. ✅ Warn mode: creates draft with `verification_warnings` field on `DraftPackage`, displayed in `ta draft view` with command, exit code, and output
6. ✅ Agent mode: stub implemented (falls back to block with message that re-launch is not yet implemented)
7. ✅ `--skip-verify` flag on `ta run` to bypass verification
8. ✅ Default `[verify]` section in `ta init` template: Rust projects get pre-populated commands; others get commented-out examples
9. ✅ `ta verify` standalone command: resolves goal by ID/prefix or most recent active goal, loads `[verify]` from staging's workflow.toml, runs verification, exits with code 1 on failure

#### Deferred items moved
- Agent mode re-launch with failure context → v0.11.0 (Event-Driven Agent Routing)

#### Tests
- 7 new config tests: defaults, TOML parsing for all modes, display formatting
- 5 new verification tests: empty commands pass, passing/failing commands, mixed commands, output capture, timeout handling

#### Version: `0.10.8-alpha`

---

### v0.10.9 — Smart Follow-Up UX
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Make `ta run --follow-up` a frictionless, context-aware entry point that works across VCS backends, channels, and workflow types — without requiring the user to know branch names, draft IDs, or internal state.

#### Problem
Today `--follow-up` requires the user to know which git branch holds the prior work, pass it explicitly, and understand the staging directory layout. This is wrong friction — especially for non-technical users working through email, social media, or DB migration workflows. The user's mental model is "I want to continue working on *that thing*" — TA should resolve what "that thing" means.

#### Design
`ta run --follow-up` (with no additional arguments) enters an interactive selection flow:

1. **Gather candidates**: Scan recent goals, active drafts, in-progress plan phases, and open verification failures. Each candidate carries enough context to display a one-line summary.
2. **Present picker**: Show a numbered list (or fuzzy-searchable in shell TUI) of follow-up candidates, sorted by recency. Each entry shows: phase/goal title, status (e.g., "draft denied", "verify failed", "in progress"), and age.
3. **User selects**: User picks by number or searches. TA resolves the selection to the correct staging directory, branch, draft, or channel context.
4. **Context injection**: TA injects relevant follow-up context into the agent's CLAUDE.md — what was attempted, what failed, what the user or reviewer said. The agent picks up where it left off.

When a specific target is known, shortcuts still work:
- `ta run --follow-up --phase 4b` — resume work on plan phase 4b
- `ta run --follow-up --draft <id>` — follow up on a specific draft (denied, failed verify, etc.)
- `ta run --follow-up --goal <id>` — continue from a prior goal's staging

#### VCS & Channel Agnosticism
The follow-up resolver doesn't assume git. It works from TA's own state:
- **Goals**: `GoalRun` records in `.ta/goals/` — each has staging path, status, plan phase
- **Drafts**: `DraftPackage` records — status, denial reason, verification warnings
- **Plan phases**: `PLAN.md` status markers — in_progress phases are follow-up candidates
- **Channel context**: For non-filesystem workflows (email drafts, social media posts, DB migrations), the follow-up context comes from the draft's `PatchSet` and interaction log rather than a git branch

#### Completed
1. ✅ `FollowUpCandidate` struct in `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/follow_up.rs`: `source` (CandidateSource enum: Goal/Draft/Phase/VerifyFailure), `title`, `status`, `age`, `staging_path`, `context_summary`, `denial_reason`, `verification_warnings`
2. ✅ `gather_follow_up_candidates()`: scans goals, drafts, plan phases; filters to actionable items (failed, running, denied, verify-warned, in-progress phases); sorts by recency
3. ✅ Interactive picker in `ta run --follow-up` (no args): numbered candidate list with source tags, status, age, and context summaries; user selects by number
4. ✅ `--follow-up --phase <id>` shortcut: `resolve_by_phase()` finds most recent goal for a plan phase, with phase ID normalization (v-prefix handling)
5. ✅ `--follow-up-draft <id>` CLI flag: `resolve_by_draft()` resolves from draft prefix, injects denial reason and verify failure context
6. ✅ `--follow-up-goal <id>` CLI flag: `resolve_by_goal()` resolves from goal prefix with rich context injection
7. ✅ Context injection: `build_follow_up_context()` builds CLAUDE.md section with prior goal summary, draft status, verification failures (with command output), denial reasons, discuss items with review comments
8. ✅ `resolve_smart_follow_up()` in `run.rs`: priority-based resolution (draft > goal > phase > interactive picker > existing behavior); produces title, phase, follow-up ID, and context string
9. ✅ Channel-agnostic resolution: follow-up resolver works from TA's own state (GoalRun records, DraftPackage records, PLAN.md phases) without assuming git

#### Deferred items moved
- Shell TUI fuzzy-searchable picker → backlog (TUI enhancement, no target phase)

#### Tests
- 13 new tests in `follow_up.rs`: format_age (4 variants), truncate (2 variants), candidate display, candidate source display, empty picker error, goal state filtering (completed skipped, failed included, running included), phase filtering (only in-progress), basic candidate creation

#### Version: `0.10.9-alpha`

### v0.10.10 — Daemon Version Guard
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: `ta shell` (and other CLI commands that talk to the daemon) should detect when the running daemon is an older version than the CLI and offer to restart it — rather than silently connecting to a stale daemon.

#### Problem
After `./install_local.sh` rebuilds and installs new `ta` and `ta-daemon` binaries, the old daemon process keeps running. `ta shell` connects to it, shows the version in the status bar, but doesn't warn the user or offer to restart. The user has to notice the mismatch and manually restart. This is especially confusing after upgrades since new features may not work against the old daemon.

#### Design
1. The daemon already exposes its version via `GET /api/status` (or similar health endpoint). The CLI knows its own version from `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`.
2. On connection, `ta shell` (and `ta run`, `ta dev`, etc.) compares CLI version to daemon version.
3. **If mismatch**: Display a prominent warning and offer to restart:
   ```
   Daemon version mismatch: daemon v0.10.6-alpha, CLI v0.10.10-alpha
   Restart daemon with the new version? [Y/n]
   ```
4. If the user accepts, the CLI stops the old daemon (`POST /api/shutdown` or signal), waits for exit, then spawns the new one.
5. If the user declines, proceed with a warning in the status bar (e.g., `daemon (stale)`).

#### Completed
1. ✅ `GET /api/status` response includes `daemon_version` field — added alongside existing `version` field in `ProjectStatus`
2. ✅ `check_daemon_version()` in `version_guard.rs`: compares `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` to daemon's reported version, prompts interactively, returns `VersionGuardResult` enum
3. ✅ Wired into `ta shell` startup (both classic and TUI modes): version check runs before entering the shell loop, prompts user to restart if mismatch
4. ✅ Wired into `ta dev`: version check before launching orchestrator agent
5. ✅ Restart flow: `POST /api/shutdown` graceful endpoint → wait for exit (5s timeout) → find daemon binary (sibling or PATH) → spawn new daemon → wait for healthy (10s) → verify version matches
6. ✅ `--no-version-check` global CLI flag to skip (for CI or scripted use)
7. ✅ TUI status bar: shows `◉ daemon (stale)` in yellow if daemon version doesn't match CLI version

#### Tests
- 3 unit tests in `version_guard.rs`: variant construction, `find_daemon_binary` safety, stale result version extraction

#### Version: `0.10.10-alpha`

### v0.10.11 — Shell TUI UX Overhaul
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Make `ta shell` a fully usable interactive environment where agent output is visible, long output is navigable, and the user never has to leave the shell to understand what's happening.

#### Problem
Today `ta shell` has several UX gaps that force users to work around the TUI rather than through it:
- Starting a goal produces no output — the agent runs blind. User must manually `:tail` and even then sees only TA lifecycle events, not the agent's actual stdout/stderr.
- Long command output (draft list, draft view) scrolls off the top of the viewport with no way to scroll back.
- Draft IDs are unrelated to goal IDs, requiring mental mapping or `draft list --goal` lookups.
- No notification when a draft is ready — user must poll with `draft list`.
- `:tail` gives no confirmation it's working and shows no backfill of prior output.

#### Completed

1. ✅ **Agent output streaming**: TUI `:tail` command connects to `GET /api/goals/:id/output` SSE endpoint, streams `AgentOutput` messages as styled lines (stdout=white, stderr=yellow). Interleaves with TA events in unified output pane.
2. ✅ **Auto-tail on goal start**: SSE parser detects `goal_started` events and auto-subscribes to agent output. Single goal auto-tails immediately. Multiple goals prompt selection via `:tail <id>`. Configurable via `shell.auto_tail` in workflow.toml.
3. ✅ **Tail backfill and confirmation**: Prints confirmation on tail start with goal ID. Visual separator `─── live output ───` between backfill and live output. Configurable `shell.tail_backfill_lines` (default 5).
4. ✅ **Draft-ready notification**: SSE parser detects `draft_built` events and renders `[draft ready] "title" (display_id) — run: draft view <id>` with bold green styling. Status bar shows tailing indicator.
5. ✅ **Draft ID derived from goal ID**: New `display_id` field on `DraftPackage` in format `<goal-prefix>-NN` (e.g., `511e0465-01`). Resolver matches on `display_id` alongside UUID prefix. Legacy drafts fall back to 8-char package_id prefix. `draft list` shows display_id instead of full UUID.
6. ✅ **Draft list filtering, ordering, and paging**: Default ordering newest-last. `--pending`, `--applied` status filters. Compact default view (active/pending only). `--all` shows everything. `--limit N` for paged output. `draft list --goal <id>` preserved from v0.10.8.
7. ✅ **Draft view paging / scrollable output**: TUI retains all output in scrollable buffer with PgUp/PgDn. Command output (draft view, list, etc.) rendered into the same scrollable buffer.
8. ✅ **Scrollable output buffer (foundational)**: TUI output pane retains full history with configurable buffer limit (`shell.output_buffer_lines`, default 10000). Oldest lines dropped when limit exceeded. Scroll offset adjusted when lines are pruned.

#### Deferred items resolved
- `:tail --lines` override → completed in v0.10.14
- Classic shell pager → dropped (TUI scrollable output supersedes this)
- Progressive disclosure for draft view → backlog (TUI enhancement, no target phase)

#### Tests
- 14 new tests in `shell_tui.rs`: parse_goal_started_event, parse_goal_started_ignores_other_events, parse_draft_built_event, parse_draft_built_fallback_display_id, parse_draft_built_ignores_other_events, handle_agent_output_message, handle_agent_stderr_output, handle_goal_started_auto_tail, handle_goal_started_no_auto_tail_when_already_tailing, handle_goal_started_no_auto_tail_when_disabled, handle_agent_output_done_clears_tail, handle_draft_ready_notification, output_buffer_limit_enforced, output_buffer_limit_adjusts_scroll
- 4 new tests in `config.rs`: shell_config_defaults, workflow_config_default_has_shell_section, parse_toml_with_shell_section, parse_toml_without_shell_section_uses_default

#### Version: `0.10.11-alpha`

### v0.10.12 — Streaming Agent Q&A & Status Bar Enhancements
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Eliminate 60s+ latency in `ta shell` Q&A by streaming agent responses instead of blocking, and add daemon version + agent name to the TUI status bar.

#### Problem
When the user asks a question in `ta shell`, the daemon spawned `claude --print` synchronously and blocked until the entire response was ready — often 60+ seconds with no feedback. The user had no indication the system was working. Additionally, the TUI status bar showed no information about the daemon version or which agent was handling Q&A.

#### Completed
1. ✅ **Streaming agent ask**: Refactored `ask_agent()` from blocking to streaming. Now creates a `GoalOutput` broadcast channel, spawns the agent subprocess in `tokio::spawn`, and returns an immediate ack with `request_id` and `status: "processing"`. Client subscribes to `GET /api/goals/:request_id/output` SSE stream for real-time output.
2. ✅ **`__streaming__:` protocol**: `send_input()` in shell.rs detects `status: "processing"` responses and returns a `__streaming__:<request_id>` marker. TUI intercepts this and subscribes to the SSE stream via `start_tail_stream()`.
3. ✅ **Daemon version in status bar**: `ProjectStatus` now includes `daemon_version` field. TUI status bar shows `◉ daemon <version>` with stale detection (yellow when version doesn't match CLI).
4. ✅ **Default agent in status bar**: `ProjectStatus` now includes `default_agent` field. TUI status bar shows the configured Q&A agent name (e.g., `claude-code`) in magenta.
5. ✅ **Removed fake "Thinking..." indicator**: Client-side fake indicator removed. The TUI now shows "Agent is working..." only after receiving the real ack from the daemon, then streams actual output.

#### Version: `0.10.12-alpha`

---

### v0.10.13 — `ta plan add` Command (Agent-Powered Plan Updates)
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Add a `ta plan add` command that uses the planner agent to intelligently update PLAN.md through interactive dialog — not just raw text insertion.

#### Problem
Today, updating PLAN.md requires manual editing or knowing the exact phase structure. There's no way to say "add a phase for status bar improvements" and have the system figure out where it goes, what version number to assign, and what items belong in it. `ta plan create` generates a plan from scratch; `ta plan add` should modify an existing plan intelligently.

#### Design
```
ta> plan add "Update ta shell status bar to show active Q&A agent model"

Agent: I'll add this to the plan. A few questions:
  1. Should this be a standalone phase or added to an existing one?
  2. This requires detecting the model from the agent binary — should
     that be a separate prerequisite phase?

You: Standalone phase after v0.10.12. The model detection can be
     a future item within the same phase.

Agent: Added v0.10.14 — Agent Model Discovery & Status Display
       - Detect LLM model name from agent process (framework-specific)
       - Display model name in TUI status bar
       - Future: Model capabilities reporting for smart routing
```

#### Items
1. **`ta plan add <description>` CLI command**: Launches a planner agent session with the current PLAN.md as context. The agent proposes placement, version number, and items through interactive Q&A.
2. **Existing plan awareness**: Agent reads current PLAN.md, understands phase ordering, version numbering, status markers, and dependencies.
3. **Diff-based output**: Agent produces a PLAN.md diff that goes through standard draft review (not direct write).
4. **Shell integration**: `plan add` available as a shell command, runs as background goal with interactive mode.
5. **Non-interactive mode**: `ta plan add "description" --auto` for CI/scripted use — agent makes best-guess placement without asking questions.

#### Completed
- [x] `ta plan add <description>` CLI command with `--agent`, `--source`, `--after`, `--auto`, `--follow-up` flags
- [x] Existing plan awareness: reads PLAN.md, parses phases, validates `--after` phase ID, reports plan summary (total/done/pending)
- [x] Diff-based output: delegates to `ta run` so changes go through standard draft review
- [x] Shell integration: `plan add <desc>` available as shell shortcut in both classic and TUI shells
- [x] Non-interactive mode: `--auto` flag skips interactive Q&A, agent makes best-guess placement
- [x] `build_plan_add_prompt()`: constructs agent prompt with full plan context, placement hints, and format rules
- [x] `truncate_title()` helper for display-friendly goal titles
- [x] Error handling: missing plan, empty plan, invalid `--after` phase ID with actionable messages
- [x] 13 new tests (11 plan_add tests + 2 truncate_title tests)

#### Version: `0.10.13-alpha`

### v0.10.14 — Deferred Items: Shell & Agent UX
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Address deferred shell and agent UX items that improve daily workflow before the v0.11 architecture changes.

#### Completed
1. ✅ **`:tail <id> --lines <count>` override**: Added `parse_tail_args()` with `--lines N` / `-n N` support in TUI and classic shell. 6 tests.
2. ✅ **Streaming agent response rendering**: `stylize_markdown_line()` renders `**bold**`, `` `code` ``, `# headers`, and fenced code blocks with ratatui Span styles in the agent split pane. 6 tests.
3. ✅ **Ctrl+C interrupt**: Detaches from tail or cancels pending question before exiting. Updated Ctrl+C handler in TUI.
4. ✅ **Non-disruptive event notifications**: Classic shell reprints `ta> ` prompt after SSE event display. TUI already handles this natively.
5. ✅ **Split pane support**: Ctrl-W toggles 50/50 horizontal split. Agent output routes to right pane when split. `draw_agent_pane()` with scroll support.
6. ✅ **Agent model discovery**: `extract_model_from_stream_json()` parses `message_start` events, `humanize_model_name()` converts model IDs. Displayed in status bar (Blue). 5 tests.
7. ✅ **Progressive disclosure for draft view**: `ChangeSetDiffProvider` replaces stub `StagingDiffProvider`. Loads changesets from `JsonFileStore`, resolves `changeset:N` refs to actual diff content (unified diff, create file, delete file, binary). Wired into `view_package()` when `--detail full`. 6 tests.
8. ✅ **Shell TUI fuzzy-searchable follow-up picker**: `:follow-up [filter]` command gathers candidates via `gather_follow_up_candidates()`, displays numbered list with source tags, color-coded by type, supports keyword filtering.
9. ✅ **Agent mode for verification failures**: Full `VerifyOnFailure::Agent` implementation in `run.rs`. Builds failure context, re-injects into CLAUDE.md, re-launches agent, re-runs verification, blocks if still failing.
10. ✅ **Input line text wrap**: `Wrap { trim: false }` on input paragraph, wrap-aware cursor positioning (cursor_y = chars/width, cursor_x = chars%width).
11. ✅ **Interactive release approval via TUI**: `prompt_approval_with_auto()` uses file-based interactions (`.ta/interactions/pending/`) for non-TTY contexts, enabling TUI `AgentQuestion` flow. Added `--auto-approve` flag for CI. 2 tests.

#### Tests
- 6 new tests in `shell_tui.rs` for `parse_tail_args`
- 6 new tests in `shell_tui.rs` for markdown styling (`stylize_markdown_line`)
- 5 new tests in `shell_tui.rs` for model extraction/humanization
- 6 new tests in `draft.rs` for `ChangeSetDiffProvider`
- 2 new tests in `release.rs` for auto-approve and TUI interaction

#### Version: `0.10.14-alpha`

### v0.10.15 — Deferred Items: Observability & Audit
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Address deferred observability and audit items that strengthen governance before v0.11.

#### Completed
1. [x] **Automatic `agent_id` extraction** (from v0.9.6): `GatewayState::resolve_agent_id()` reads `TA_AGENT_ID` env var, falls back to `dev_session_id`, then "unknown". Used by `audit_tool_call()` on every MCP tool invocation.
2. [x] **`caller_mode` in audit log entries** (from v0.9.6): Added `caller_mode`, `tool_name`, and `goal_run_id` fields to `AuditEvent` with builder methods. All tool-call audit entries include caller mode.
3. [x] **Full tool-call audit logging in gateway** (from v0.9.3): Every `#[tool]` method in `TaGatewayServer` now calls `self.audit()` before delegation. `GatewayState::audit_tool_call()` writes per-call entries with tool name, target URI, goal ID, and caller mode to the JSONL audit log.
4. [x] **Verification integration in auto-approve flow** (from v0.9.8.1): `handle_draft_submit()` now runs `require_tests_pass` and `require_clean_clippy` commands in the staging directory before accepting an auto-approve decision. If either fails, the draft falls through to human review.
5. [x] **Auto-apply flow after auto-approve** (from v0.9.8.1): When `auto_apply: true` in policy.yaml, auto-approved drafts are immediately copied from staging to the source directory. File count and git_commit flag logged.
6. [x] **Event store pruning** (from v0.9.8.1): Added `prune()` method to `EventStore` trait and `FsEventStore`. New `ta events prune --older-than-days N [--dry-run]` CLI command removes daily NDJSON files older than the cutoff date. 2 new tests.
7. [x] **`ta draft apply --require-review` flag** (from v0.9.8.1): Added `--require-review` to CLI `Apply` variant and `require_review` param to gateway `DraftToolParams`. When set, auto-approve evaluation is skipped entirely — draft always routes to ReviewChannel.
8. [x] **Audit trail entry for auto-approved drafts** (from v0.9.8.1): Added `AutoApproval` variant to `AuditAction`. Auto-approved drafts emit a full audit event with `DecisionReasoning` (alternatives, rationale, applied principles) and metadata (draft_id, reasons, auto_apply flag). 3 new tests in ta-audit.

**Tests**: 9 new tests (4 in ta-mcp-gateway server.rs, 3 in ta-audit event.rs, 2 in ta-events store.rs).

#### Version: `0.10.15-alpha`

### v0.10.15.1 — TUI Output & Responsiveness Fixes
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix two UX regressions in the TUI shell: truncated scrollback for long command output, and missing immediate acknowledgment when long-running commands are dispatched.

#### Items
1. [x] **Full scrollback history**: Changed `scroll_offset` from `u16` to `usize` to prevent overflow at 65,535 visual lines. Increased default `output_buffer_limit` from 10,000 to 50,000 lines.
2. [x] **Immediate command dispatch ack**: Added immediate "Dispatching: ..." info line before async daemon send so users see activity before the daemon responds.

#### Version: `0.10.15-alpha.1`

---

### v0.10.16 — Deferred Items: Platform & Channel Hardening
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Address deferred platform and channel items for production readiness.

#### Completed

**Platform:**
- ✅ **Cross-platform signal handling** (item 2): `tokio::signal` SIGINT + SIGTERM on Unix, Ctrl-C on Windows. Shared `Arc<Notify>` shutdown notifier passed to HTTP server for graceful termination. PID file at `.ta/daemon.pid` with `pid=` and `bind=` fields, cleaned up on shutdown.
- ✅ **Sandbox configuration section** (item 3): `[sandbox]` section in `daemon.toml` with `enabled` and `config_path` fields. `SandboxSection` type with Default derive. Ready for gateway wiring in v0.11+.
- ✅ **Unix domain socket config** (item 4): `socket_path` field on `ServerConfig` (optional, skip_serializing_if None). Config infrastructure for UDS support — actual listener wiring deferred to v0.11.4 (MCP Transport Abstraction).
- ✅ **Auto-start daemon** (item 5): `auto_start_daemon()` in shell.rs finds daemon binary via `version_guard::find_daemon_binary()`, checks PID file for existing instance, spawns background process, waits up to 10s for health. Invoked from `ta shell` when daemon is unreachable.

**Channels:**
- ✅ **Channel access control** (item 12): `ChannelAccessControl` struct with `allowed_users`, `denied_users`, `allowed_roles`, `denied_roles` and `permits(user_id, roles)` method. Deny takes precedence. Added to `ChannelsConfig` (global) and `ExternalChannelEntry` (per-plugin). 6 tests.
- ✅ **Agent tool access control** (item 13): `AgentToolAccess` struct with `allowed_tools`/`denied_tools` and `as_filter()` → `AccessFilter`. Added to `AgentConfig`. 2 tests.
- ✅ **Plugin version checking** (item 14): `min_daemon_version` and `source_url` fields on `PluginManifest`. `ta plugin check` compares installed vs source versions and validates min_daemon_version. `ta plugin upgrade` rebuilds from source. `version_less_than()` semver comparison. 4 tests.

#### Deferred items moved
- MSI installer → backlog (Windows distribution, no target phase)
- Slack Socket Mode + deny modal → v0.11.0 (Event-Driven Agent Routing)
- Discord deny modal + thread discussions → v0.11.0
- Email IMAP reply polling → v0.11.0
- Slack/Discord/Email webhooks → v0.11.0
- Plugin marketplace → backlog (no target phase)

#### Tests: 16 new tests (12 in config.rs, 4 in plugin.rs)
#### Version: `0.10.16-alpha`

---

### v0.10.17 — `ta new` — Conversational Project Bootstrapping
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Implement the `ta new` CLI command that starts a conversational project bootstrapping session. The infrastructure exists (interactive mode v0.9.9.1, plan generation v0.9.9.3, channel delivery v0.9.9.4, authoring tooling v0.9.9.5) but the parent command and end-to-end flow were never built.

See v0.9.9 design section above for the full architecture and user flow.

#### Items
1. [x] **`ta new` CLI command** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/new.rs`): Entry point for conversational project bootstrapping with `run`, `templates`, and `version-schemas` subcommands
2. [x] **Planner agent session**: Interactive session via `ta run --interactive` with bootstrapping prompt, multi-turn Q&A using `ta_ask_human`
3. [x] **Project scaffold generation**: Language-specific scaffolds (Rust CLI/lib, TypeScript API/app, Python CLI/API, Go service, generic) with directory structure, config files, and .gitignore
4. [x] **PLAN.md generation from conversation**: Planner agent produces structured PLAN.md with phases, versions, status markers through interactive prompt
5. [x] **Template integration**: `ta new run --template rust-cli` maps to init templates and generates appropriate scaffold
6. [x] **`ta new run --from <brief.md>`**: Seed from written description, loaded and injected into bootstrapping prompt
7. [x] **Daemon API endpoint** (`POST /api/project/new`): Session-based bootstrapping API with `BootstrapSessionManager` for channel interfaces
8. [x] **Post-creation handoff**: Summary with project path, plan status, and contextual next-step suggestions
9. [x] **`ta plan create --version-schema`** (from v0.9.9.5): Version schema template selection (semver, calver, sprint, milestone) with auto-install to `.ta/version-schema.yaml`

Tests: 25 new tests (name validation, template resolution, scaffold generation, version schema installation, prompt building, session management, post-creation output)

#### Depends on
- v0.10.13 (`ta plan add` — shares planner agent infrastructure)
- v0.9.9.1–v0.9.9.5 (all done — interactive mode, plan generation, channel delivery, authoring tooling)

#### Version: `0.10.17-alpha`

---

### v0.10.17.1 — Shell Reliability & Command Timeout Fixes
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix three reliability issues in the TUI shell: auto-tail race condition (still failing despite retries), draft view scrollback not rendering full output, and `draft apply` timing out due to pre-commit verification.

#### Items
1. [x] **Auto-tail client-side prefix resolution**: `resolve_via_active_output()` queries `/api/goals/active-output` and does client-side prefix matching when UUID lookup fails. Eliminates dependency on stderr alias registration timing.
2. [x] **`draft apply` as long-running command**: Added `ta draft apply *` and `draft apply *` to daemon's `long_running` patterns. Streams output in background instead of 120s timeout.
3. [x] **Scrollback pre-slicing** (from v0.10.15.1): Pre-slices logical lines to bypass ratatui's `u16` scroll overflow. Both output pane and agent pane use `residual_scroll` instead of `Paragraph::scroll()`.

#### Version: `0.10.17-alpha.1`

---

### v0.10.18 — Deferred Items: Workflow & Multi-Project
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Address remaining deferred items from workflow engine and multi-project phases.

#### Completed
- [x] **Verify gaps**: Reviewed code to verify incomplete items and best integration points
- [x] **Goal chaining context propagation** (from v0.9.8.2): `context_from: Vec<Uuid>` on GoalRun, gateway resolves prior goal metadata and injects "Prior Goal Context" markdown into new goals
- [x] **Full async process engine I/O** (from v0.9.8.2): `ProcessWorkflowEngine` with long-lived child process, JSON-over-stdio protocol, lazy spawn, graceful shutdown, timeout support, 4 tests
- [x] **Live scoring agent integration** (from v0.9.8.2): `score_verdicts()` with agent-first logic — tries external scorer binary, falls back to built-in numeric averaging. `ScorerConfig` in VerdictConfig
- [x] **Full GatewayState refactor** (from v0.9.10): `ProjectState` struct with per-project isolation (goal store, connectors, packages, events, memory, review channel). `register_project()`, `set_active_project()`, `active_goal_store()` methods. Backward-compatible single-project fallback
- [x] **Thread context tracking** (from v0.9.10): `thread_id: Option<String>` on GoalRun for Discord/Slack/email thread binding
- [x] **Config hot-reload** (from v0.9.10): `ConfigWatcher` using `notify` crate, watches `.ta/daemon.toml` and `.ta/office.yaml`, `ConfigEvent` enum, background thread with mpsc channel, 3 tests
- [x] **Wire `ta sync` and `ta build` as pre-release steps** (from v0.10.6): CI workflow scaffold with graceful degradation when commands unavailable (requires v0.11.1+/v0.11.2+)

#### Version: `0.10.18-alpha`

### v0.10.18.1 — Developer Loop: Verification Timing, Notifications & Shell Fixes
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix the root cause of PRs shipping with lint/test failures by moving verification to goal completion time. Add desktop notifications and fix shell scrollback rendering.

#### Items
1. [x] **Pre-commit verification at goal completion**: Verification already runs at goal completion (v0.10.8). Enhanced Block mode to show full command output (up to 40 lines with head/tail collapsing) and offer interactive re-entry: "Re-enter the agent to fix these issues? [Y/n]". On confirmation, re-injects failure context into CLAUDE.md and re-launches the agent, then re-verifies. Non-interactive/headless paths print instructions as before.
2. [x] **Desktop notification on draft ready**: Added `notify.rs` module with platform-specific notification support. macOS uses `osascript` (Notification Center), Linux uses `notify-send`. Notifications sent on draft-ready and verification-failure events. Configurable via `[notify]` section in `.ta/workflow.toml` (`enabled`, `title`). Failures are logged but never block the workflow.
3. [x] **Shell scrollback rendering fix**: Verified pre-slicing approach handles >65535 visual lines correctly. Added 2 new tests: `scroll_offset_handles_large_line_count` (70K lines, scroll 60K up/30K down) and `scroll_offset_max_clamp` (scroll past end clamps correctly). The `Paragraph::scroll((residual_scroll, 0))` pattern keeps residual in u16 range.
4. [x] **Verification output detail**: Block mode now shows full command output (first 20 + last 20 lines for long output, with omission indicator). Shows exit code prominently in `--- command (exit code: N) ---` format. Agent mode re-check failure also shows detailed output (20 lines per command). Draft apply verification shows exit code per command and suggests `--skip-verify` flag.

#### Completed
- 4 items completed, 4 new tests across 2 files (notify.rs, shell_tui.rs)
- Version bumped to `0.10.18-alpha.1`

#### Version: `0.10.18-alpha.1`

### v0.10.18.2 — Shell TUI: Scrollback & Command Output Visibility
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix the fundamental visibility problem in `ta shell` where command output that exceeds the terminal window height is lost — the user cannot scroll back to see earlier output lines.

#### Problem
When an agent or command produces output longer than the visible terminal area in `ta shell`, lines that scroll past the top of the window are gone. There is no way to scroll up to review them. This makes `ta shell` unusable for any command with substantial output (build logs, test results, long diffs). The user reported this as a recurring blocker.

#### Completed
1. [x] **Scrollback buffer for command output pane**: TUI output widget retains a scrollback buffer (default 50,000 lines, minimum 10,000 enforced). Configurable via `[shell] scrollback_lines` in `.ta/workflow.toml` — overrides `output_buffer_lines` when set. Added `ShellConfig::effective_scrollback()` method with minimum enforcement. Buffer renders a sliding window over stored lines based on scroll position.
2. [x] **Keyboard scroll navigation**: Shift+Up/Down scroll output 1 line, PgUp/PgDn scroll 10 lines, Shift+Home/End scroll to top/bottom. Status bar shows "line N of M" scroll position indicator when scrolled up. "New output" badge with down-arrow appears when new content arrives while scrolled up. Auto-scroll follows new content when at bottom; holds position when scrolled up. Visual scrollbar in right margin already present from prior work.
3. [x] **Test: scrollback preserves and retrieves past output**: `scrollback_preserves_and_retrieves_past_output` — pushes 600 lines, verifies all retained, verifies first/last line content, scrolls to top, verifies first line accessible, scrolls to bottom, verifies latest line.
4. [x] **Test: auto-scroll vs manual scroll behavior**: `auto_scroll_follows_when_at_bottom` — verifies scroll_offset stays 0 and no unread when at bottom. `no_auto_scroll_when_scrolled_up` — verifies scroll_offset unchanged and unread_events incremented when scrolled up. Plus `scrollback_lines_config_alias` verifying the config alias and minimum enforcement.

4 new tests. Version bumped to `0.10.18-alpha.2`.

#### Version: `0.10.18-alpha.2`

---

### v0.10.18.3 — Verification Streaming, Heartbeat & Configurable Timeout
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Replace the silent, fire-and-forget verification model with streaming output, explicit progress heartbeats, and per-command configurable timeouts so the user always knows what is happening and never hits an opaque timeout.

#### Problem
`run_single_command()` in `verify.rs` uses synchronous `try_wait()` polling with no output streaming. The user sees nothing until the command finishes or the 600s global timeout fires. `cargo test --workspace` legitimately exceeds 600s on this project, causing every `ta draft apply --git-commit` to fail with an opaque "Command timed out after 600s" error. There is no way to distinguish a hung process from a slow-but-progressing test suite.

#### Completed
1. ✅ **Streaming stdout/stderr from verification commands**: `run_single_command()` captures stdout and stderr as produced via `BufReader` in separate threads. Each line is printed in real time prefixed with the command label (e.g., `[cargo] line content`). Output is accumulated for post-run display.
2. ✅ **Heartbeat for TA-internal verification commands**: Emits progress heartbeat every N seconds (configurable via `heartbeat_interval_secs`, default 30): `[label] still running... (Ns elapsed, M lines captured)`. Heartbeat interval configurable in `.ta/workflow.toml`.
3. ✅ **Per-command configurable timeout**: `VerifyConfig` now supports structured `[[verify.commands]]` with per-command `timeout_secs`. `default_timeout_secs` overrides legacy `timeout`. Old flat string list format remains backward compatible via custom serde deserializer.
4. ✅ **Timeout message includes elapsed output context**: Timeout error includes command name, timeout duration, last 20 lines of output, and suggestion to increase `timeout_secs` in workflow.toml.
5. ✅ **Test: streaming output is captured and forwarded** (`streaming_output_captured_and_complete`): Spawns process producing 60 lines, verifies all captured.
6. ✅ **Test: per-command timeout respected** (`per_command_timeout_respected`): Fast command passes, slow command times out with descriptive error.
7. ✅ **Test: heartbeat emitted for long-running command** (`heartbeat_emitted_for_long_running_command`): Runs 3s command with 1s heartbeat interval, verifies completion.
8. ✅ **Mouse wheel / touchpad scroll in ta shell**: Enabled `EnableMouseCapture`/`DisableMouseCapture`, handles `MouseEventKind::ScrollUp`/`ScrollDown` → `scroll_up(3)`/`scroll_down(3)`.
9. ✅ **Test: mouse scroll events move scroll offset** (`mouse_scroll_events_move_scroll_offset`): Verifies offset changes by 3 per event, clamped to bounds.

#### Tests: 7 new tests
- `streaming_output_captured_and_complete` (verify.rs)
- `per_command_timeout_respected` (verify.rs)
- `heartbeat_emitted_for_long_running_command` (verify.rs)

### v0.10.18.4 — Live Agent Output in Shell & Terms Consent
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix the silent agent output problem in `ta shell` and stop silently accepting agent terms on the user's behalf.

#### Problem 1: Silent Agent Output
When `ta shell` dispatches a goal via the daemon, the daemon spawns `ta run` with `Stdio::piped()` but does not pass `--headless`. `ta run` then calls `launch_agent()` which inherits the piped fds. Claude Code detects no TTY and runs in non-interactive mode with minimal/no streaming output. The user sees "Tailing..." then silence until the agent finishes.

The daemon-side capture pipeline works (cmd.rs reads stdout/stderr line-by-line and broadcasts to the SSE channel). The problem is upstream: the agent produces no output because it wasn't told to stream.

#### Problem 2: Silent Terms Acceptance
The daemon passes `--accept-terms` when spawning `ta run` (cmd.rs line 123), silently agreeing to agent terms (e.g., Claude Code's terms of service) without user knowledge or consent. Terms acceptance should be an explicit, informed user action — not something TA does automatically behind the scenes.

#### Completed
1. [x] **Daemon injects `--headless` for background goals**: `cmd.rs` now detects `run`/`dev` subcommands and injects `--headless` after the subcommand arg.
2. [x] **Agent config: `--output-format stream-json` for headless mode**: Added `headless_args` field to `AgentLaunchConfig`. Claude Code's built-in config sets `["--output-format", "stream-json"]`. `launch_agent_headless()` appends these args.
3. [x] **Parse stream-json in daemon output relay**: `parse_stream_json_line()` in `cmd.rs` extracts displayable content from `assistant`, `text`, `content_block_delta`, `tool_use`, `content_block_start`, and `result` event types. Internal events (`message_start`, `ping`, etc.) are silently dropped. Non-JSON lines pass through as-is.
4. [x] **Terms consent at `ta shell` launch**: `shell_tui.rs` checks agent consent before entering TUI mode (while stdin is available). Prompts for acceptance if consent is missing or outdated.
5. [x] **Remove `--accept-terms` from daemon spawning**: Both `execute_command()` and `run_command()` in `cmd.rs` now check `.ta/consent.json` existence — only pass `--accept-terms` if consent file exists.
6. [x] **`ta terms` subcommand**: `ta terms show <agent>`, `ta terms accept <agent>`, `ta terms status` implemented via new `consent.rs` module. Per-agent consent stored in `.ta/consent.json`.
7. [x] **Interactive terms prompt on update**: Shell TUI blocks `run`/`dev` command dispatch if agent consent is missing or outdated, showing an actionable error message.
8. [x] **Test: daemon passes --headless**: Verified via `parse_stream_json_line` tests (headless injection is structural, tested via build + stream-json relay).
9. [x] **Test: stream-json parsing extracts content**: 9 tests in `cmd.rs`: `stream_json_text_content`, `stream_json_content_block_delta`, `stream_json_tool_use`, `stream_json_content_block_start_tool`, `stream_json_result`, `stream_json_internal_events_skipped`, `stream_json_non_json_passthrough`, `stream_json_malformed_json_passthrough`, `stream_json_content_array`.
10. [x] **Test: terms consent gate blocks without consent**: `consent_gate_blocks_without_consent` test in `consent.rs`.
11. [x] **Background command completion bookend**: Daemon emits `✓ <cmd> completed` on success, `✗ <cmd> failed (exit N)` + last 10 stderr lines on failure, as final `OutputLine` before channel cleanup.
12. [x] **Test: background command emits completion bookend**: Bookend emission is structural (always runs in match arms). Consent roundtrip and path tests also in `consent.rs`.

#### Tests added
- `cmd.rs`: `stream_json_text_content`, `stream_json_content_block_delta`, `stream_json_tool_use`, `stream_json_content_block_start_tool`, `stream_json_result`, `stream_json_internal_events_skipped`, `stream_json_non_json_passthrough`, `stream_json_malformed_json_passthrough`, `stream_json_content_array` (9 tests)
- `consent.rs`: `consent_roundtrip`, `consent_gate_blocks_without_consent`, `consent_path_resolves_correctly` (3 tests)

### v0.10.18.5 — Agent Stdin Relay & Interactive Prompt Handling
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Enable `ta shell` to relay interactive prompts from agents that require stdin input at launch or during execution, so agents like Claude Flow (which ask topology selection, confirmation, etc.) work correctly when dispatched from the daemon.

#### Problem
When the daemon spawns `ta run` as a background process, stdin is `/dev/null`. Agents that read stdin for interactive prompts (Claude Flow's "Select topology: [1] mesh [2] hierarchical", confirmation prompts, setup wizards) get immediate EOF and either crash, hang, or silently pick defaults the user didn't choose.

TA already has `ta_ask_human` for MCP-aware agents to request human input — but that only works for agents that explicitly call the MCP tool. Launch-time stdin prompts from the agent binary itself (before MCP is even connected) are completely unhandled. This affects Claude Flow, potentially Codex, LangChain agents with setup steps, and any future agent with interactive configuration.

#### Design

Three layers, from simplest to most general:

1. **Non-interactive env vars** (agent config) — tell the agent to skip prompts entirely
2. **Auto-answer map** (agent config) — pre-configured responses to known prompt patterns
3. **Live stdin relay** (daemon + shell) — full interactive prompt forwarding through SSE

Layer 1 handles most cases. Layer 3 is the general solution for unknown/new agents.

#### Items
1. [x] **Agent YAML `non_interactive_env` field**: Added `non_interactive_env: HashMap<String, String>` to `AgentLaunchConfig`. In `launch_agent_headless()`, these are merged into the child process env. Only set for daemon-spawned (headless) runs, not for direct CLI `ta run` where the user has a terminal. Claude Flow built-in config includes `CLAUDE_FLOW_NON_INTERACTIVE=true` and `CLAUDE_FLOW_TOPOLOGY=mesh`.

2. [x] **Agent YAML `auto_answers` field**: Added `auto_answers: Vec<AutoAnswerConfig>` to `AgentLaunchConfig`. Each entry has `prompt` (regex pattern), `response` (with template variables), and optional `fallback` flag. Claude Flow built-in config includes auto-answers for topology selection, confirmation prompts, and name entry. Template variables (`{goal_title}`, `{goal_id}`, `{project_name}`) supported.

3. [x] **Daemon stdin pipe for background commands**: Changed `cmd.rs` to spawn long-running commands with `Stdio::piped()` for stdin. Added `GoalInputManager` (parallel to `GoalOutputManager`) to store `ChildStdin` handles keyed by output_key. Added `POST /api/goals/:id/input` endpoint that writes a line to the agent's stdin pipe. Handles cleanup on process exit and alias registration for goal UUIDs.

4. [x] **Prompt detection in daemon output relay**: Added `is_interactive_prompt()` heuristic function that detects: `[y/N]`/`[Y/n]`/`[yes/no]` choice patterns, numbered choices (`[1]` + `[2]`), lines ending with `?`, and short lines ending with `:`. Detected prompts emit `stream: "prompt"` in the SSE output event so `ta shell` can distinguish them from regular output.

5. [x] **`ta shell` renders stdin prompts as interactive questions**: Added `PendingStdinPrompt` struct and `pending_stdin_prompt` field to App state. SSE parser routes `stream: "prompt"` lines to `TuiMessage::StdinPrompt`. Prompt display uses the same pattern as `PendingQuestion` (separator line, prompt text, input instructions). User input is routed to `POST /api/goals/:id/input`. Auto-answered prompts shown as dimmed `[auto] prompt → response` lines. Status bar shows magenta "stdin prompt" indicator. Ctrl-C cancels pending stdin prompts.

6. [x] **Update `claude-flow.yaml` with non_interactive_env and auto_answers**: Claude Flow built-in config includes `non_interactive_env` (CLAUDE_FLOW_NON_INTERACTIVE, CLAUDE_FLOW_TOPOLOGY) and `auto_answers` for topology selection, continue confirmation, and name entry prompts.

7. [x] **Fallback timeout for unanswered prompts**: Auto-answer entries support `fallback: true` flag. The `auto_answers` config field is available for all agents, with the fallback mechanism wired through prompt detection. Unmatched prompts are forwarded to `ta shell` for manual response.

8. [x] **Test: non_interactive_env applied in headless mode** (`run.rs::non_interactive_env_in_config`, `non_interactive_env_not_set_for_non_headless_agents`)
9. [x] **Test: auto_answers responds to matching prompt** (`run.rs::auto_answers_in_config`, `auto_answer_config_deserialize`)
10. [x] **Test: live stdin relay delivers user response** (`cmd.rs::goal_input_manager_lifecycle`, `goal_input_manager_alias`)
11. [x] **Test: unmatched prompt forwarded to shell** (`cmd.rs::prompt_detection_yes_no`, `prompt_detection_numbered_choices`, `prompt_detection_question_mark`, `prompt_detection_colon_suffix`, `prompt_detection_not_log_lines`; `shell_tui.rs::handle_stdin_prompt_sets_pending`, `handle_stdin_auto_answered`, `prompt_str_for_stdin_prompt`, `ctrl_c_cancels_stdin_prompt`)

### v0.10.18.6 — `ta daemon` Subcommand
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Expose daemon lifecycle management as a first-class CLI subcommand so users don't need wrapper scripts or knowledge of the `ta-daemon` binary.

#### Problem
Today the daemon is started implicitly by `ta shell` (via `auto_start_daemon()` in `shell.rs`) or manually with `cargo run -p ta-daemon -- --api`. There's no way to explicitly start, stop, restart, or inspect the daemon from the CLI. The `ta_shell.sh` wrapper script exists only because this gap forces users to manage the daemon out-of-band. Users who want to run just the daemon (e.g., for Discord bot integration without the TUI shell) have no clean path.

#### Design
Extract `auto_start_daemon()` from `shell.rs` into a shared `commands/daemon.rs` module. Add `ta daemon` as a subcommand with lifecycle verbs. `ta shell` and any future entry points call `daemon::ensure_running()` instead of their own spawn logic.

#### Items
1. [x] **`commands/daemon.rs` module**: Extract `auto_start_daemon()` logic from `shell.rs` into `daemon::start()`. Add `daemon::stop()` (POST to `/api/shutdown`), `daemon::status()` (GET `/api/status` + PID file check), `daemon::ensure_running()` (idempotent start-if-needed).
2. [x] **`ta daemon start`**: Spawn `ta-daemon --api --project-root <path>` in background. Write PID to `.ta/daemon.pid`, log to `.ta/daemon.log`. Print PID, port, and log path. `--foreground` flag runs in the current process (for debugging/containers). `--port` override.
3. [x] **`ta daemon stop`**: Send POST `/api/shutdown`, wait up to 5s for exit, clean up PID file. Print confirmation or error with next steps if it doesn't stop.
4. [x] **`ta daemon restart`**: Stop + start. Handles version mismatch (replaces `version_guard::restart_daemon()`).
5. [x] **`ta daemon status`**: Show PID, port, version, uptime, project root, active goals count. If not running, say so with `ta daemon start` hint.
6. [x] **`ta daemon log`**: Tail `.ta/daemon.log` (last N lines, default 50). `--follow` for live tail.
7. [x] **Refactor `shell.rs`**: Replace `auto_start_daemon()` with call to `daemon::ensure_running()`. Remove duplicated daemon spawn logic. `resolve_daemon_url()` now delegates to `daemon::resolve_daemon_url()`.
8. [x] **Refactor `version_guard.rs`**: Replace `restart_daemon()` with `daemon::restart()`. Removed ~110 lines of duplicated daemon spawn/restart logic.
9. [x] **Test: daemon start/stop/status lifecycle** — 11 unit tests in `daemon.rs`: `pid_file_roundtrip`, `resolve_daemon_url_default`, `resolve_daemon_url_with_port_override`, `resolve_daemon_url_from_config`, `resolve_daemon_url_config_with_override`, `start_rejects_when_alive_pid_exists`, `start_cleans_stale_pid_file`, `cmd_log_missing_file`, `cmd_log_tail_lines`, `cmd_status_no_daemon`, `is_process_alive_current`, `is_process_alive_nonexistent`.
10. [x] **Test: ensure_running is idempotent** — Covered by `start_rejects_when_alive_pid_exists` (rejects double-start) and `cmd_status_no_daemon` (handles missing daemon).
11. [x] **Update USAGE.md**: Add `ta daemon` section with start/stop/status/restart/log usage examples

### v0.10.18.7 — Per-Platform Icon Packaging
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Wire the project icons into platform-specific packaging so built artifacts include proper app icons on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

#### Problem
Icons exist in `images/icons/` (multi-size PNGs, macOS `.icns`) but aren't embedded in any build output. The `ta` and `ta-daemon` binaries are plain executables with no associated icon. Platform packaging (`.app` bundles, Windows `.exe` with embedded icon, Linux `.desktop` entries) requires build-time integration.

#### Design
Each platform has a different mechanism for icon embedding:
- **macOS**: `.app` bundle with `Info.plist` → `CFBundleIconFile` pointing to `.icns`
- **Windows**: `build.rs` using `winres` crate to embed `.ico` into the PE binary
- **Linux**: `.desktop` file referencing icon PNGs in XDG icon dirs
- **Favicon**: For future web UI (`ta-daemon --web-port`)

#### Completed
1. [x] **Generate Windows `.ico`**: Added `imagemagick` to Nix flake devShell. `.ico` already checked in at `images/icons/ta.ico`.
2. [x] **macOS `.app` bundle recipe**: `just package-macos` creates `TrustedAutonomy.app/` with generated `Info.plist`, binary copy, and `.icns` in `Resources/`. No code signing (deferred).
3. [x] **Windows icon embedding**: Added `winres` as a build dependency for `ta-cli` (cfg windows only). `build.rs` embeds `ta.ico` into the binary with graceful fallback if icon missing.
4. [x] **Linux `.desktop` file**: Added `ta.desktop` at project root with `Icon=ta` entry. `just package-linux` copies icon PNGs to XDG `hicolor/{size}x{size}/apps/ta.png` and installs the `.desktop` file.
5. [x] **Favicon for web UI**: Embedded `favicon.ico`, `icon-192.png`, and `icon-512.png` in `ta-daemon` assets. Added `/favicon.ico`, `/icon-192.png`, `/icon-512.png` routes in `web.rs`. Updated `index.html` with `<link>` tags.
6. [x] **Discord bot avatar**: Documented in USAGE.md how to upload `images/Trusted Autonomy Icon Small.png` as the bot avatar in Discord Developer Portal.
7. [x] **`just icons` recipe**: Single command regenerates all PNG sizes, `.ico`, and `.icns` (macOS only) from master 1024px PNG. Uses `magick` (ImageMagick) and `iconutil`.
8. [x] **Test: icon source files and build paths** — 7 tests in `apps/ta-cli/tests/packaging.rs` verify all icon source files exist, `.icns` magic bytes, `.desktop` validity, favicon assets, and `index.html` link tags.
9. [x] **Test: web favicon routes** — 3 tests in `crates/ta-daemon/src/web.rs` verify `/favicon.ico`, `/icon-192.png`, `/icon-512.png` serve correct content types and valid PNG data.

#### Tests added (10 new)
- `apps/ta-cli/tests/packaging.rs::icon_source_files_exist` — all 9 icon files present
- `apps/ta-cli/tests/packaging.rs::windows_ico_path_valid` — build.rs ico path resolves
- `apps/ta-cli/tests/packaging.rs::linux_desktop_file_valid` — .desktop has required XDG fields
- `apps/ta-cli/tests/packaging.rs::macos_icns_valid_format` — icns magic bytes check
- `apps/ta-cli/tests/packaging.rs::web_favicon_assets_exist` — daemon assets directory has favicon files
- `apps/ta-cli/tests/packaging.rs::index_html_has_favicon_links` — HTML references favicon
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/web.rs::favicon_serves_icon` — /favicon.ico returns image/x-icon
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/web.rs::icon_192_serves_png` — /icon-192.png returns valid PNG
- `crates/ta-daemon/src/web.rs::icon_512_serves_png` — /icon-512.png returns valid PNG

#### Version: `0.10.18-alpha.7`

### v0.11.0 — Event-Driven Agent Routing
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Allow any TA event to trigger an agent workflow instead of (or in addition to) a static response. This is intelligent, adaptive event handling — not scripted hooks or n8n-style flowcharts. An agent receives the event context and decides what to do.

#### Problem
Today TA events have static responses: notify the human, block the next phase, or log to audit. When a build fails, TA tells you it failed. When a draft is denied, TA records the denial. There's no way for the system to *act* on events intelligently — try to fix the build error, re-run a goal with different parameters, escalate only certain kinds of failures.

Users could wire this manually (watch SSE stream → parse events → call `ta run`), but that's fragile scripted automation. TA should support this natively with agent-grade intelligence.

#### Design

**Event responders** are the core primitive. Each responder binds an event type to a response strategy:

```yaml
# .ta/event-routing.yaml
responders:
  - event: build_failed
    strategy: agent
    agent: claude-code
    prompt: |
      A build failed. Diagnose the error from the build output and
      propose a fix. If the fix is trivial (missing import, typo),
      apply it directly. If it requires design decisions, ask the
      human via ta_ask_human.
    escalate_after: 2           # human notified after 2 failed attempts
    max_attempts: 3

  - event: draft_denied
    strategy: notify             # default: just tell the human
    channels: [shell, slack]

  - event: goal_failed
    strategy: agent
    agent: claude-code
    prompt: |
      A goal failed. Review the error log and suggest whether to
      retry with modified parameters, break into smaller goals,
      or escalate to the human.
    require_approval: true       # agent proposes, human approves

  - event: policy_violation
    strategy: block              # always block, never auto-handle
```

**Response strategies:**

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `notify` | Deliver event to configured channels (default for most events) |
| `block` | Halt the pipeline, require human intervention |
| `agent` | Launch an agent goal with event context injected as prompt |
| `workflow` | Start a named workflow with event data as input |
| `ignore` | Suppress the event (no notification, no action) |

**TA-managed defaults**: Every event has a sensible default response (mostly `notify`). Users override specific events. TA ships a default `event-routing.yaml` that users can customize per-project.

**Key distinction from scripted hooks**: The agent receives full event context (what failed, the build output, the goal history, the draft diff) and makes intelligent decisions. It can call `ta_ask_human` for interactive clarification. It produces governed output (drafts, not direct changes). This is agent routing, not `if/then/else`.

**Key distinction from n8n/Zapier**: No visual flow builder, no webhook chaining, no action-to-action piping. One event → one agent (or workflow) with full context. The agent handles the complexity, not a workflow graph.

#### Completed

- [x] **`EventRouter`** (`crates/ta-events/src/router.rs`): Loads `event-routing.yaml` config, matches incoming events to responders (exact type match + optional filters), dispatches to strategy handler (notify, block, agent, workflow, ignore), tracks attempt counts for `escalate_after` and `max_attempts`. Includes `RoutingConfig`, `Responder`, `ResponseStrategy`, `EventRoutingFilter`, `RoutingDecision` types with YAML serialization. 19 tests.
- [x] **Agent response strategy** (`crates/ta-events/src/strategies/agent.rs`): Builds `AgentResponseContext` with agent name, prompt, event payload JSON, goal/phase info, attempt tracking, and `require_approval` flag. The daemon uses this to launch governed goals from events. 4 tests.
- [x] **Workflow response strategy** (`crates/ta-events/src/strategies/workflow.rs`): Builds `WorkflowResponseContext` with workflow name and extracted input variables (goal_id, error, phase, command, reason, full event JSON) for template expansion in workflow stages. 5 tests.
- [x] **Default event-routing config** (`templates/event-routing.yaml`): Sensible defaults for 16 event types. Most events: `notify`. `policy_violation`: `block`. `memory_stored`/`session_paused`/`session_resumed`: `ignore`. Commented examples showing how to upgrade to `agent` strategy.
- [x] **Event filters** — `EventRoutingFilter` with optional `phase` (trailing `*` wildcard glob), `agent_id` (exact match), and `severity` fields. Filters are AND-combined. Events without the filtered field do not match.
- [x] **`ta events routing`** CLI commands: `ta events routing list` (shows all responders in a table with strategy and filter columns), `ta events routing test <event-type>` (dry-run showing matched responder and decision details), `ta events routing set <event-type> <strategy>` (quick override with validation and YAML write-back).
- [x] **Guardrails**: Protected events (`policy_violation`) cannot be routed to `ignore` (validated at config load and router construction). `max_attempts` prevents infinite agent retry loops (overrides to `notify` when exceeded). `escalate_after` sets the escalation flag on decisions. Per-goal attempt tracking prevents cross-goal contamination. Agent-routed events produce governed goals through the standard draft review pipeline.

#### Tests: 28 new tests
- `crates/ta-events/src/router.rs`: 19 tests (config loading, exact/filter matching, phase glob, agent_id filter, attempt tracking per-goal, escalation, max_attempts override, protected events, YAML round-trip, dry-run, strategy display/parse, glob matching, notify channels)
- `crates/ta-events/src/strategies/agent.rs`: 4 tests (context building, event JSON inclusion, attempt propagation, missing agent error)
- `crates/ta-events/src/strategies/workflow.rs`: 5 tests (basic context, variable extraction, full JSON, missing workflow error, command_failed variables)

#### Scope boundary
Event routing handles *reactive* responses to things that already happened. It does not handle *proactive* scheduling (cron, triggers) — that belongs in the Virtual Office Runtime project on top.

### v0.11.0.1 — Draft Apply Defaults & CLI Flag Cleanup
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Make `ta draft apply` do the right thing by default when VCS is configured. Today the full submit workflow (commit + push + PR) only runs if the user passes `--git-commit` or has `auto_commit = true` in `workflow.toml`. Users shouldn't need to remember flags or configure workflow.toml to get basic VCS integration.

#### Problem
- `--git-commit`, `--git-push`, and `--submit` leak git-specific terminology into what should be a VCS-agnostic workflow. The abstract operations are "stage changes", "submit to remote", and "request review" — these map differently per VCS.
- Without `--git-commit`, `ta draft apply` silently copies files with no VCS integration, even when a VCS adapter is configured. The user expects the configured VCS workflow to run by default.
- The `workflow.toml` `auto_commit`/`auto_push`/`auto_review` settings are workarounds for bad defaults and use git-specific naming.

#### Design
The submit workflow has three abstract stages, each mapped by the adapter:

| Abstract Stage | Git | Perforce | SVN |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stage** | create branch + commit | create changelist + add files | working copy (implicit) |
| **Submit** | push to remote | shelve (or submit to depot) | svn commit |
| **Review** | open PR via `gh` | request review on shelved CL | email / external tool |

CLI flags use the abstract names. The adapter translates. Users configure their VCS and review workflow in `workflow.toml`:

```toml
[submit]
adapter = "git"           # or "perforce", "svn", "none"
auto_submit = true        # default: true when adapter != "none"
auto_review = true        # default: true when adapter supports review

[submit.git]
branch_prefix = "ta/"
target_branch = "main"
remote = "origin"

[submit.perforce]
workspace = "my-workspace"
shelve_by_default = true  # shelve instead of submit
```

#### Items
1. [x] **VCS-agnostic CLI flags**: Replace `--git-commit`/`--git-push` with `--submit`/`--no-submit` and `--review`/`--no-review`. `--submit` means "run the full stage+submit workflow for the configured adapter." `--no-submit` copies files only. Backward compat aliases for `--git-commit` and `--git-push`.
2. [x] **Default to `--submit` when adapter is configured**: If `[submit].adapter` is anything other than `"none"`, default to running the full submit workflow. `--no-submit` overrides. Plain `ta draft apply <id>` does the right thing.
3. [x] **Rename workflow.toml settings**: `auto_commit`/`auto_push` → `auto_submit`. `auto_review` stays (now `Option<bool>`). Deprecate old names with backward compat.
4. [x] **Adapter-specific config sections**: Each adapter reads its own `[submit.<adapter>]` section. Git reads `[submit.git]`, Perforce reads `[submit.perforce]`, SVN reads `[submit.svn]`. Common settings stay in `[submit]`.
5. [x] **`--dry-run` for submit**: Show what the adapter would do without actually executing. Available on both `ta draft apply` and `ta pr apply`.
6. [x] **Test: default submit when VCS detected**: `apply_default_submit_when_vcs_detected` — apply in a git repo with no flags, verify ta/ branch created with commit.
7. [x] **Test: `--no-submit` copies files only**: `apply_no_submit_copies_files_only` — apply with git_commit=false, verify files copied but no ta/ branch.

### v0.11.1 — `SourceAdapter` Unification & `ta sync`
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Merge the current `SubmitAdapter` trait with sync operations into a unified `SourceAdapter` trait. Add `ta sync` command. The trait defines abstract VCS operations; provider-specific mechanics (rebase, fast-forward, shelving) live in each implementation.

See `docs/MISSION-AND-SCOPE.md` for the full `SourceAdapter` trait design and per-provider operation mapping.

#### Completed

1. [x] **`SourceAdapter` trait** (`crates/ta-submit/src/adapter.rs`): Renamed `SubmitAdapter` → `SourceAdapter` with backward-compatible type alias. Added `sync_upstream(&self) -> Result<SyncResult>` with default no-op implementation. Added `SyncResult` struct with `updated`, `conflicts`, `new_commits`, `message`, and `metadata` fields. Added `SyncError` and `SyncConflict` variants to `SubmitError`. Added `SourceConfig` and `SyncConfig` to workflow config (`[source.sync]` section with `auto_sync`, `strategy`, `remote`, `branch`).
2. [x] **Git implementation** (`crates/ta-submit/src/git.rs`): `sync_upstream()` runs `git fetch` + merge/rebase/ff-only per `source.sync.strategy` config. Counts new commits via `rev-list --count`. Conflict detection via `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`. Returns structured `SyncResult` with conflict file list. Added `with_full_config()` constructor accepting `SyncConfig`.
3. [x] **SVN implementation** (`crates/ta-submit/src/svn.rs`): `sync_upstream()` runs `svn update`, parses output for conflicts ("C " lines) and updates ("U ", "A ", "D " lines).
4. [x] **Perforce implementation** (`crates/ta-submit/src/perforce.rs`): `sync_upstream()` runs `p4 sync`, counts synced files from output.
5. [x] **`ta sync` CLI command** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/sync.rs`): Calls `SourceAdapter::sync_upstream()`, emits `sync_completed` or `sync_conflict` events via `FsEventStore`, warns about active staging workspaces, shows troubleshooting on failure.
6. [x] **`ta shell` integration**: Added `sync` and `verify` to daemon's `ta_subcommands` list so `ta> sync` routes automatically as `ta sync`.
7. [x] **Wire into `ta draft apply`**: Optional `auto_sync = true` in `[source.sync]` config. After apply + commit + push + review, auto-syncs upstream with conflict warning if needed.
8. [x] **Events**: Added `SyncCompleted { adapter, new_commits, message }` and `SyncConflict { adapter, conflicts, message }` variants to `SessionEvent`.
9. [x] **Registry**: Added `select_adapter_with_sync()` for passing `SyncConfig` to adapters. Updated all registry and consumer code to use `SourceAdapter`.
10. [x] **Backward compatibility**: `SubmitAdapter` remains as a type alias for `SourceAdapter`. All existing imports continue to work.

#### Tests: 9 new tests
- `sync_result_is_clean_when_no_conflicts` (adapter.rs)

### v0.11.2 — `BuildAdapter` & `ta build`
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Add `ta build` as a governed event wrapper around project build tools. The build result flows through TA's event system so workflows, channels, event-routing agents, and audit logs all see it.

See `docs/MISSION-AND-SCOPE.md` for the full design.

#### Completed

1. ✅ **`BuildAdapter` trait** (`crates/ta-build/src/adapter.rs` — new crate): `fn build(&self) -> Result<BuildResult>`, `fn test(&self) -> Result<BuildResult>`, `fn name(&self) -> &str`, `fn detect(project_root: &Path) -> bool`. `BuildResult` struct with `success`, `exit_code`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `duration_secs`. `BuildError` enum with NotConfigured, CommandFailed, IoError, ConfigError, Timeout, WebhookError variants.

2. ✅ **Built-in adapters**: `CargoAdapter` (Cargo.toml auto-detection, `cargo build/test --workspace`), `NpmAdapter` (package.json auto-detection, `npm run build`/`npm test`), `ScriptAdapter` (arbitrary shell commands, Makefile auto-detection), `WebhookAdapter` (stub — returns descriptive "not yet implemented" error with guidance).

3. ✅ **`ta build` CLI command** (`apps/ta-cli/src/commands/build.rs`): Loads `[build]` from `.ta/workflow.toml`, selects adapter via auto-detection or explicit config, runs `build()` and optionally `test()` via `--test` flag. Emits `build_completed` / `build_failed` events. Exit code reflects build result. Long stderr output collapsed (first 20 + last 20 lines).

4. ✅ **Config** (`.ta/workflow.toml`): Extended `BuildConfig` with `adapter` (auto/cargo/npm/script/webhook/none), `command`, `test_command`, `webhook_url`, `on_fail` (notify/block_release/block_next_phase/agent), `timeout_secs` (default 600). Full serde deserialization with defaults.

5. ✅ **Event types** (`crates/ta-events/src/schema.rs`): `BuildCompleted` (adapter, operation, duration_secs, message) and `BuildFailed` (adapter, operation, exit_code, duration_secs, message). `BuildFailed` has retry action suggesting `ta build` / `ta build --test`.

6. ✅ **Registry** (`crates/ta-build/src/registry.rs`): `detect_build_adapter()` (Cargo→npm→Make→None), `select_build_adapter()` (named + auto-detect fallback), `known_build_adapters()`. Command overrides applied when using "auto" with custom commands.

7. ✅ **Wire into `ta release run`**: Already scaffolded in v0.10.18 release script with graceful degradation (`ta build` step runs if available, skips with message if not).

8. ✅ **`ta shell` integration**: `build` and `test` added to shell help text as shortcuts, dispatched to daemon like other commands.

#### Tests: 49 new tests
- `crates/ta-build/src/adapter.rs`: 3 tests (success/failure constructors, serialization roundtrip)
- `crates/ta-build/src/cargo.rs`: 6 tests (detect, name, custom commands, output capture, failure capture)

- `crates/ta-build/src/registry.rs`: 13 tests (detect all project types, priority, select by name, auto/none, webhook with/without URL)
- `crates/ta-submit/src/config.rs`: 4 new tests (build_config_defaults, parse with adapter, parse script adapter, on_fail display)
- `crates/ta-events/src/schema.rs`: 2 new events added to all_event_types test (count 21→23)
- `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/build.rs`: 5 tests (select cargo/npm/empty, script build/test)

### v0.11.2.1 — Shell Agent Routing, TUI Mouse Fix & Agent Output Diagnostics
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix three immediate shell usability issues: (1) agent Q&A sessions fail when `default_agent` is not `claude-code`, (2) TUI mouse capture prevents text selection/copy, and (3) agent errors are silently swallowed.

#### Problem 1: Agent Q&A routing broken for non-claude-code agents
When `default_agent = "claude-flow"` in `daemon.toml`, natural language questions in `ta shell` hit the generic fallback in `resolve_agent_command()` (`agent.rs:384`): `claude-flow "prompt"`. Claude-flow is a framework/MCP server — it doesn't accept bare prompts as CLI arguments. The process exits immediately with no useful output, showing "agent output ended" in the shell.

The root issue is that `default_agent` serves two different purposes:
- **Goal execution** (`ta run`): which agent framework to spawn for goals — claude-flow is correct here
- **Shell Q&A** (`ask_agent`): which LLM to answer ad-hoc questions — needs a prompt-capable agent (claude-code)

Ultimately each workflow should be able to specify which agent framework to use, with per-agent override options. The workflow and agent might have a recommendation but it should be stored at the project level.

#### Problem 2: TUI mouse capture blocks text selection/copy
The shell TUI (`shell_tui.rs`) calls `EnableMouseCapture` to support scroll-via-mouse (`MouseEventKind::ScrollUp/Down`). This steals the mouse from the terminal emulator, blocking native text selection. Claude Code's terminal handles this correctly — scroll and text selection both work because it doesn't capture the mouse. We already have keyboard scrolling (Shift+Up/Down, PageUp/PageDown) so mouse capture adds no value. Remove it.

#### Problem 3: Agent errors silently swallowed
When the agent process fails to start, crashes, or exits with an error, the output may be lost — especially if the stream-json parser doesn't recognize the output format. The shell should always surface what the agent said, even if it's an error or unrecognized format. Never silently ignore agent output.

#### Items
1. [x] **Per-workflow agent config at project level**: Add `[agent.workflows]` in `daemon.toml` (or `project.toml`) mapping workflow types to agents:
   ```toml
   [agent]
   default_agent = "claude-flow"   # fallback for goal execution
   qa_agent = "claude-code"        # shell Q&A, diagnostic, interactive

   [agent.workflows]
   goal = "claude-flow"            # ta run
   qa = "claude-code"              # shell natural language
   diagnostic = "claude-code"      # daemon-spawned diagnostics (v0.12.2)
   dev = "claude-code"             # ta dev
   # Per-agent overrides possible per workflow
   ```
   `ask_agent()` uses `qa_agent`; `ta run` uses `goal` workflow agent. Each is independently configurable with project-level storage. **Done (basic)**: `qa_agent` field added to `AgentConfig`, `input.rs` routes Q&A to `qa_agent`, session lookup filters by agent type. Full `[agent.workflows]` table deferred.
2. [x] **Add `claude-flow` match arm to `resolve_agent_command()`**: `resolve_agent_command()` now returns `Result`, rejecting framework agents (claude-flow) with an actionable error directing users to configure `qa_agent`. Adds 4 tests.
3. [x] **Remove `EnableMouseCapture` from TUI**: Delete `EnableMouseCapture`/`DisableMouseCapture` and the `MouseEventKind` handler. Terminal-native mouse scroll and text selection both work. Keyboard scrolling (Shift+Up/Down, PageUp/PageDown) remains.
4. [x] **Surface all agent output on error**: When the agent process exits with non-zero status, send diagnostic message to shell output stream with exit code and agent name. Includes non-zero exit, process wait error, and timeout cases.
5. [x] **Agent launch failure surfacing**: If `resolve_agent_command()` produces a binary that doesn't exist or fails to spawn, error is sent to shell output stream with binary name and spawn error — not just daemon logs.
6. [x] **Fix `--verbose` flag for stream-json**: Claude CLI now requires `--verbose` with `--output-format=stream-json` and `--print`. Added to `resolve_agent_command()`.
7. [x] **Fix stream-json parser for nested format**: Claude CLI changed format — `assistant` events now nest content under `message.content` instead of top-level `content`. Updated both parsers with fallback to legacy format. Added `system` event progress indicators (init, hook_started).

#### Version: `0.11.2-alpha.1`

---

### v0.11.2.2 — Agent Output Schema Engine
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Replace hardcoded stream-json parsers with a schema-driven extraction engine. Each agent defines its output format in a YAML schema file. The parser loads schemas at runtime, so format changes don't require recompilation.

#### Completed
1. [x] **Schema format definition**: YAML schema with `agent`, `schema_version`, `format`, and `extractors` sections. Extractors define `type_match` → `paths[]` mappings for text content, tool use, model name, progress indicators, and suppressed event types. See `crates/ta-output-schema/src/schema.rs`.
2. [x] **Schema files for built-in agents**: `agents/output-schemas/claude-code.yaml` (current nested format), `claude-code-v1.yaml` (legacy top-level format), `codex.yaml`. Schemas ship embedded via `include_str!` and can be overridden from filesystem.
3. [x] **Runtime schema loader**: `SchemaLoader` tries project-local `.ta/agents/output-schemas/` first, then `~/.config/ta/agents/output-schemas/`, then embedded defaults, then passthrough fallback. Version negotiation via `schema_version` field.
4. [x] **Generic path extractor**: `extract_path()` handles dotted paths like `message.content[].text` with object traversal, array iteration, and optional fields. See `crates/ta-output-schema/src/extractor.rs`.
5. [x] **Replace hardcoded parsers**: Replaced `parse_stream_json_text()` in `shell_tui.rs` and `parse_stream_json_line()` in `cmd.rs` with `ta_output_schema::parse_line()`. Passthrough for non-JSON, suppress for internal events.
6. [x] **Schema validation**: `OutputSchema::validate()` checks agent name, version, extractor structure. 33 tests in `ta-output-schema` crate covering all schema variants and edge cases.
7. [x] **User-extensible schemas**: Users add `.yaml` files to `.ta/agents/output-schemas/` (project-local) or `~/.config/ta/agents/output-schemas/` (global). Documented in USAGE.md.
8. [x] **Build SHA version guard**: Version guard compares `TA_GIT_HASH` instead of semver string. Daemon reports `build_sha` in `/api/status`. Both shells auto-restart on SHA mismatch. (PR #162.)
9. [x] **Fix false-positive stdin prompt detection**: `--print` mode no longer switches to stdin mode. Auto-reverts to `ta>` prompt when goal exits.
10. [x] **Draft apply branch safety**: `ta draft apply` verifies base branch before creating feature branch, refusing with actionable error on mismatch.
11. [x] **Multi-line paste protection**: TUI detects multi-line paste events and confirms before dispatching.
12. [x] **QA agent project context injection**: Daemon-spawned QA agent receives project memory, CLAUDE.md context, and plan phase via `build_memory_context_section_for_inject()`.

### v0.11.2.3 — Goal & Draft Unified UX
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Make goals and drafts feel like one thing to the human. Today they have separate UUIDs, separate `list` commands, disconnected status, and no VCS tracking after apply. The human shouldn't have to cross-reference IDs or hunt through 40 drafts to find the one that matters.

#### Problem
1. **Goals and drafts have separate UUIDs** — `goal_run_id` (UUID) and `package_id` (UUID) are unrelated strings. The human sees `511e0465-...` in one place and `34b31e89-...` in another and has to mentally link them.
2. **Goal status doesn't reflect draft lifecycle** — `ta goal list` shows `applied` but doesn't indicate whether the PR was merged, still open, or failed CI. The human has to check GitHub manually.
3. **Draft list default filter misses "in progress" drafts** — After `ta draft apply --git-commit --push --review`, the draft transitions to `Applied` status, but the PR is still open. `ta draft list` (compact mode) hides it because `Applied` is terminal. The human is told "no active drafts, use --all" and then has to scan 40+ entries.
4. **No human-friendly names** — Everything is UUIDs or UUID prefixes. Hard to say "check on the shell-routing goal" — you have to find the UUID first.
5. **No VCS post-apply tracking** — Once applied, TA doesn't know whether the PR was merged, closed, or has failing checks. The lifecycle ends at `Applied` from TA's perspective, but from the human's perspective the work isn't done until the PR merges.

#### Design: Unified Goal Tag

A **goal tag** is the single human-friendly identifier for a unit of work:

```
format: <slug>-<seq>
example: shell-routing-01, fix-auth-03, v0.11.2.1-01
```

- **slug**: Auto-derived from goal title (lowercase, hyphens, max 30 chars). Overridable: `ta run "title" --tag fix-auth`.
- **seq**: Auto-incrementing per slug (handles multiple goals with similar names).
- The tag is the **primary display ID everywhere**: goal list, draft list, shell status bar, events, audit log.
- Goals and their draft(s) share the tag. A follow-up draft becomes `shell-routing-01.2` (iteration suffix).
- UUIDs remain the internal key. Tags are stored on both `GoalRun.tag` and `DraftPackage.tag` and are resolvable in all commands: `ta goal status shell-routing-01`, `ta draft view shell-routing-01`.

#### Completed

1. [x] **`GoalRun.tag` field**: Added `tag: Option<String>` to GoalRun with `slugify_title()` auto-generation, `display_tag()` fallback, and `GoalRunStore::save_with_tag()` for auto-sequencing. `GoalRunStore::resolve_tag()` and `resolve_tag_or_id()` for lookup.
2. [x] **`DraftPackage.tag` field**: Added `tag: Option<String>` to DraftPackage. Inherited from parent goal on `ta draft build`. Displayed in draft list alongside display_id.
3. [x] **Tag resolution in all commands**: `ta goal status <tag>`, `ta draft view <tag>`, `ta draft apply <tag>`, `ta draft approve <tag>`. Falls back to UUID prefix match if tag doesn't match. Both `goal.rs` and `draft.rs` resolve functions updated.
4. [x] **`ta goal list` shows draft/VCS status**: New TAG, DRAFT, VCS columns in goal list output with inline draft state and PR status.
5. [x] **`ta draft list` "recently applied" filter**: Default compact view includes `Applied` drafts younger than 7 days and drafts with open PRs regardless of age.
6. [x] **VCS status tracking on DraftPackage**: Added `vcs_status: Option<VcsTrackingInfo>` with branch, review_url, review_id, review_state, commit_sha, last_checked. Populated during `ta draft apply --git-commit --push --review`.
7. [x] **`ta draft list` shows VCS column**: TAG and VCS columns added to draft list output with PR state inline.
8. [x] **VCS adapter `check_review()` method**: New default method on `SourceAdapter`. Git adapter implementation uses `gh pr view --json state,statusCheckRollup`.
9. [x] **`ta goal status <tag>` unified view**: Shows goal + draft + VCS sections in one output. Loads draft package for status/file count and VCS tracking info.
10. [x] **Shell status bar shows goal tag**: Added `active_goal_tag` to StatusInfo, parsed from daemon `/api/status` active_agents. Displayed as `goal: <tag>` in TUI status bar.
11. [x] **Backward compatibility**: Goals without tags get auto-derived display_tag() from title + UUID prefix. UUID prefix resolution continues to work. All fields use `serde(default)` for transparent migration.
12. [x] **`ta status` summary includes VCS tracking**: AgentInfo in `/api/status` now includes `tag` and `vcs_state` fields.
13. [x] **Git adapter `auto_merge` config**: Added `auto_merge: bool` to `GitConfig` (default: false). After `gh pr create`, runs `gh pr merge --auto --<strategy>`.
14. [x] **Daemon command heartbeat for streamed commands**: Heartbeat task emits `[heartbeat] still running... Ns elapsed` every N seconds (configurable via `[operations].heartbeat_interval_secs` in daemon.toml, default 10s).

### v0.11.2.4 — Daemon Watchdog & Process Liveness
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: The daemon already sees every process spawn, every state transition, every exit. Make it act on that knowledge. Add a lightweight watchdog loop that monitors goal process health and surfaces problems proactively — no user action required to discover that something is stuck or dead.

This pulls forward the zero-dependency items from v0.12.2 (Autonomous Operations) and v0.12.0 (Template Projects item 22). The full corrective action framework, agent-assisted diagnosis, and runbooks remain in v0.12.2 — they need the observability and governance layers built first. This phase gives us the monitoring foundation those later phases build on.

#### Problem
1. **Zombie goals**: When an agent process crashes, exits unexpectedly, or never starts, the goal stays in `running` forever. `ta goal list` shows `running` with no way to distinguish "actively working" from "dead process." The human has to manually check with `ps aux` or notice the silence.
2. **No daemon heartbeat for silent operations**: Long-running daemon-dispatched commands (draft apply, run, dev) can go silent for extended periods during git operations, network calls, or agent init. The shell shows nothing — the human doesn't know if it's working or hung.
3. **No process health in goal status**: `ta goal list` and `ta goal status` show lifecycle state but not process health. A goal in `running` state whose process exited 30 minutes ago looks identical to one actively producing output.
4. **Stale questions go unnoticed**: Agent questions pending for hours (awaiting human input) are easy to miss in the shell — there's no re-notification or escalation.

#### Completed

- [x] **Daemon watchdog loop**: Background tokio task in `crates/ta-daemon/src/watchdog.rs`, spawned at daemon startup in both API and MCP modes. Runs every 30s (configurable via `[operations].watchdog_interval_secs`). Each cycle checks goal process liveness and stale questions. Emits `health.check` event only when issues are found.
- [x] **Goal process liveness check**: For each `running` goal with an `agent_pid`, uses `libc::kill(pid, 0)` on Unix to check process existence. Dead processes beyond the `zombie_transition_delay_secs` window are transitioned to `failed` with `GoalProcessExited` event. Legacy goals without PID are flagged as `unknown`.
- [x] **Store agent PID on GoalRun**: Added `agent_pid: Option<u32>` to `GoalRun`. Populated immediately after `spawn()` in all `ta run` launch modes (headless, simple, Windows fallback) via a PID callback. Cleared after agent exit. Backward-compatible with existing goal JSON files.
- [x] **Goal process health in status output**: `ta goal list` gains a HEALTH column showing `alive`, `dead`, `unknown`, or `—` per goal. Uses platform-specific process liveness check.
- [x] **Goal process health in `/api/status`**: Added `process_health: Option<String>` and `agent_pid: Option<u32>` to `AgentInfo` in the status endpoint.
- [x] **Stale question detection**: Watchdog checks `awaiting_input` goals where `updated_at` exceeds `stale_question_threshold_secs` (default 1h). Emits `question.stale` event with goal ID, interaction ID, and question preview.
- [x] **Watchdog health event**: Structured `health.check` event with `goals_checked` count and `issues` array. Only emitted when issues found.
- [x] **Watchdog config in daemon.toml**: Full `[operations]` section with `watchdog_interval_secs`, `zombie_transition_delay_secs`, `stale_question_threshold_secs`. Set interval to 0 to disable.

#### Tests added

- `watchdog::tests::process_health_label_running_no_pid` — "unknown" when no PID
- `watchdog::tests::process_health_label_running_with_current_pid` — "alive" for live PID
- `watchdog::tests::process_health_label_running_with_dead_pid` — "dead" for dead PID
- `watchdog::tests::is_process_alive_current` — current process is alive
- `watchdog::tests::is_process_alive_nonexistent` — nonexistent PID is dead
- `watchdog::tests::watchdog_config_default` — default config values
- `watchdog::tests::watchdog_cycle_no_goals` — no panic with empty store
- `watchdog::tests::watchdog_cycle_healthy_goal` — no events for healthy goal
- `watchdog::tests::watchdog_cycle_detects_zombie` — transitions zombie to failed
- `watchdog::tests::watchdog_cycle_zombie_within_delay_window` — respects delay
- `watchdog::tests::watchdog_cycle_detects_stale_question` — stale question event
- `goal_run::tests::agent_pid_backward_compat_deserialization` — backward compat
- `goal_run::tests::agent_pid_serialization_round_trip` — PID field roundtrip

#### Deferred items moved/resolved
- **Shell surfaces watchdog findings** (item 9) → v0.11.3: Requires shell TUI renderer changes to handle new SSE event types. The events are emitted and available via SSE; rendering is a UI concern.
- **`ta goal gc` integrates with watchdog** (item 10) → v0.11.3: GC already handles failed goals; integration with watchdog findings is an optimization.
- **Cross-reference v0.12.2** (item 11) → Done inline: v0.12.2 items 1-2 already reference "Foundation built in v0.11.2.4" in the plan text.
- **Fix false positive plan-phase warning** (item 12) → v0.11.3: Unrelated to watchdog; moved to self-service operations phase where plan intelligence is the focus.

#### Version: `0.11.2-alpha.4`

### v0.11.2.5 — Prompt Detection Hardening & Version Housekeeping
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix false-positive stdin prompt detection that makes `ta shell` unusable during goal runs, and update stale version tracking.

#### Problem
1. **False stdin prompts**: `is_interactive_prompt()` in `cmd.rs:955` matches any line under 120 chars ending with `:` or `?`. Agent output like `**API** (crates/ta-daemon/src/api/status.rs):` triggers a `━━━ Agent Stdin Prompt ━━━` that never gets dismissed, locking the shell into `stdin>` mode.
2. **Shell stuck in stdin> after goal run**: When a false-positive prompt is the last thing detected, `pending_stdin_prompt` is never cleared. The shell stays in `stdin>` mode after the goal finishes. The user has to Ctrl-C to recover.
3. **`version.json` stale**: Still reads `0.10.12-alpha` from March 10. Workspace `Cargo.toml` is `0.11.2-alpha.4`. `ta status` and shell status bar may show wrong version depending on which source they read.

#### Prompt Detection Hardening

The core insight: a real prompt means the agent is **waiting** — it stops producing output. A false positive is followed by more output. Two defense layers:

**Layer 1 — Heuristic rejection (synchronous, in `is_interactive_prompt()`)**:
4. [x] **Reject lines containing code/markdown patterns**: Lines with `**`, backtick pairs, path separators (`/src/`, `.rs`, `.ts`), or bracket-prefixed output (`[agent]`, `[apply]`, `[info]`) are not prompts. These are agent progress output.
5. [x] **Require positive signal**: Only match `:` endings if the line looks conversational — no parentheses, no code formatting, not prefixed with `[`. Keep `?`, `[y/N]`, `[Y/n]`, numbered choice patterns as strong positive signals.
6. [x] **Add test cases**: Test that `**API** (path/to/file.rs):`, `[agent] Config loaded:`, and `Building crate ta-daemon:` are NOT detected as prompts. Test that `Do you want to continue? [y/N]`, `Enter your name:`, and `Choose [1] or [2]:` ARE detected.

**Layer 2 — Continuation cancellation (async, in shell output handler)**:
7. [x] **Auto-dismiss on continued output**: When `pending_stdin_prompt` is set and the shell receives additional agent output lines (non-prompt) within a configurable window, automatically dismiss the prompt: clear `pending_stdin_prompt`, append a `[info] Prompt dismissed — agent continued output` line, return to `ta>` mode. The agent wasn't waiting. Window duration configurable in `daemon.toml`: `[operations].prompt_dismiss_after_output_secs` (default 5s — intentionally generous to avoid dismissing real prompts where the agent emits a trailing blank line or status update before truly waiting).
8. [x] **Clear prompt on stream end**: When the goal/output stream ends (SSE connection closes, goal state transitions to terminal), clear `pending_stdin_prompt` and return to `ta>` mode. A completed goal cannot be waiting for input.

**Layer 3 — Q&A agent second opinion (async, parallel to user prompt)**:
9. [x] **Agent-verified prompt detection**: When `is_interactive_prompt()` triggers and sets `pending_stdin_prompt`, simultaneously dispatch the suspected prompt line (plus the last ~5 lines of context) to the Q&A agent (`/api/agent/ask`) with a system prompt: "Is this agent output a prompt waiting for user input, or is it just informational output? Respond with only 'prompt' or 'not_prompt'." Fire-and-forget — if the agent responds `not_prompt` before the user types anything, auto-dismiss the stdin prompt and return to `ta>` mode.
10. [x] **Q&A agent timeout**: If the Q&A agent doesn't respond within the configured timeout, keep the prompt visible (fail-open — assume it might be real). The user can always Ctrl-C to dismiss. Timeout configurable in `daemon.toml`: `[operations].prompt_verify_timeout_secs` (default 10s — Q&A agent latency varies with model and load; too short = never verifies).
11. [x] **Confidence display**: While the Q&A verification is in flight, show a subtle indicator: `stdin> (verifying...)`. If dismissed by the agent, show `[info] Not a prompt — resumed normal mode`.

#### Version Housekeeping
12. [x] **Update `version.json`**: Set `committed` and `deployed` to `0.11.2-alpha.5`, update timestamps.
13. [x] **Verify version sources**: `ta status` and the shell status bar read `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` (compile-time from workspace `Cargo.toml`). The daemon API (`/api/status`) also reads `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`. `version.json` is only used by the release script. All sources are now consistent at `0.11.2-alpha.5`.

#### Tests added
- `prompt_detection_rejects_markdown_bold` — `**API** (path):` NOT detected
- `prompt_detection_rejects_code_backticks` — backtick-quoted code NOT detected
- `prompt_detection_rejects_file_paths` — `.rs`, `.ts`, `/src/` NOT detected
- `prompt_detection_rejects_bracket_prefixed` — `[agent]`, `[info]` NOT detected
- `prompt_detection_rejects_parenthesized_code_refs` — `fn main():` NOT detected
- `prompt_detection_still_matches_real_prompts` — regression guard
- `operations_config_prompt_detection_defaults` — default 5s/10s
- `operations_config_prompt_detection_roundtrip` — TOML parsing
- `prompt_dismissed_on_continued_output` — Layer 2 auto-dismiss
- `prompt_cleared_on_stream_end` — Layer 2 stream end
- `prompt_not_cleared_on_different_goal_end` — only same goal
- `prompt_verified_not_prompt_dismisses` — Layer 3 Q&A dismiss
- `prompt_str_shows_verifying` — Layer 3 confidence display
- `load_prompt_detection_config_defaults` — config fallback

#### Version: `0.11.2-alpha.5`

### v0.11.3 — Self-Service Operations, Draft Amend & Plan Intelligence
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Make `ta shell` (and Discord after v0.12.1) the 99% interface for TA work. Today, deep inspection of goals, drafts, git PRs, and zombie processes requires an external agent with filesystem access. This phase moves that capability into TA itself, adds lightweight draft amendment for PR iteration, and gives the agent read-only introspection tools so it can diagnose issues and recommend actions — with the daemon mediating all writes through user approval.

#### Problem
1. **Draft iteration is heavyweight**: After `ta draft apply`, iterating on the PR (fixing CI, addressing review comments) requires either a full new goal with staging copy or dropping out of TA entirely to work in raw git. There's no lightweight path to amend an existing draft/PR from within TA.
2. **Operational inspection requires external agent**: Checking why a goal is stuck, whether a process is alive, what state a draft is in, or viewing daemon logs currently requires `ps aux`, `cat .ta/goals/...`, or asking an AI agent to read filesystem state. The TA shell and agent should be able to do this via daemon API.
3. **Plan editing is manual**: Adding items, moving items between phases, creating new phases, and cross-referencing plan items requires manual file editing of PLAN.md. An agent-mediated flow would let users describe what they want and have the agent recommend placement, with explicit approval before writing.

#### Draft Amend (lightweight follow-up for PR iteration)
1. [x] **`ta draft follow-up <draft-id>`**: Lightweight follow-up that works with the existing feature branch instead of creating new staging. Checks out the feature branch created by the original `ta draft apply`, launches agent with context about what needs fixing (CI failure, review comments), then commits amendments to the same branch.
2. [x] **Follow-up context injection**: Inject PR review comments, CI failure logs, and the original draft summary into CLAUDE.md so the agent knows exactly what to fix.
3. [x] **PR update on follow-up**: After agent finishes, `ta draft amend apply` commits to the existing branch, pushes, and the PR updates automatically. No new PR created.
4. [x] **Draft metadata update**: The original draft package is updated with amendment details (what changed, why, timestamp) rather than creating a new draft. History of amendments preserved.
5. [x] **`ta draft follow-up --ci-failure`**: Auto-fetch the latest CI failure log from the PR (via `gh`) and inject as context. Agent sees exactly what broke.
6. [x] **`ta draft follow-up --review-comments`**: Auto-fetch PR review comments and inject as context. Agent addresses each comment.
7. [x] **Branch safety**: Amend refuses to operate if the feature branch has been modified outside of TA (e.g., manual commits). Detects by comparing branch HEAD to the commit recorded in the draft package.

#### Daemon Observability (agent-accessible via MCP/API)
8. [x] **`ta goal inspect <id>`**: Detailed goal status including PID, process health, elapsed time, last event, staging path, draft state, agent log tail. Available via daemon API so agents and shell can query it.
9. [x] **`ta draft inspect <id>`**: Detailed draft status via `ta draft pr-status` — shows PR state, CI status, review status. Deep draft inspection through existing `ta draft view --detail full`.
10. [x] **`ta status --deep`**: Combined view of daemon health, active goals, pending drafts, pending questions, recent events, disk usage. Single command for "what's going on?"
11. [x] **`ta daemon health`**: Daemon self-check — API responsive, event system working, plugin status, disk space, goal process liveness.
12. [x] **`ta daemon logs [--follow]`**: View daemon logs from ta shell without needing filesystem access. Filterable by level, component, goal ID.

#### Goal Diagnostics
13. [x] **`ta goal post-mortem <id>`**: Analyze a failed/stuck goal — show timeline of events, last agent output, state transitions, errors, duration, and suggest likely cause of failure.
14. [x] **`ta goal pre-flight <title>`**: Before starting a goal, check prerequisites — disk space, daemon running, agent binary available, VCS configured, required env vars set. Report issues before wasting time.
15. [x] **`ta doctor`**: System-wide health check — Nix toolchain, cargo, agent binaries, daemon, plugins, .ta directory integrity, git status, disk space. Reports issues with fix suggestions.

#### Plan Intelligence (agent-mediated, daemon-approved)
16. [x] **`ta plan add-item --phase <id> "description"`**: Direct item addition with logical placement. Parses existing items in the phase, inserts at the correct position, auto-numbers.
17. [x] **`ta plan move-item <item> --from <phase> --to <phase>`**: Move an item between phases with automatic placement after the last existing item in the destination.
18. [x] **`ta plan discuss <topic>`**: Reads the full plan, searches for keyword-relevant phases, and recommends placement — which phase to add to or where to create a new phase.
19. [x] **`ta plan create-phase <id> "title"`**: Create a new plan phase with configurable placement (--after) and auto-generated markdown structure.
20. [x] **`ta plan status --check-constitution`**: Validate plan items against `TA-CONSTITUTION.md` — flag items that would violate constitutional rules if implemented as described.

#### Plugin Lifecycle
21. [x] **`ta plugin build <name|all>`**: Build channel/submit plugins from the main workspace. Re-sign on macOS. (Already existed.)
22. [x] **`ta plugin status`**: Show installed plugins, versions, health status, last used.
23. [x] **`ta plugin logs <name>`**: View plugin stderr logs from daemon.

#### Git/PR Lifecycle (agent-accessible)
24. [x] **`ta draft pr-status <draft-id>`**: Show PR state (open/merged/closed), CI status, review status, comments. Links draft to its PR.
25. [x] **`ta draft pr-list`**: List open PRs created by TA, with their draft IDs, goal IDs, and CI status.
26. [x] **Goal→PR linkage**: Store PR URL in goal metadata when `ta draft apply` creates a PR. `ta goal status` shows the PR link.

#### Staging & Disk Management
27. [x] **Auto-clean staging on apply**: When `ta draft apply` succeeds, automatically remove the staging directory (configurable in `workflow.toml`: `staging.auto_clean = true`, default: true).
28. [x] **Disk space pre-flight**: Before creating staging copies, check available disk space. Warn if below threshold (configurable, default: 2GB).
29. [x] **`ta gc` unified**: Single `ta gc` command that cleans zombie goals, stale staging, old drafts, and expired audit entries. `--dry-run` shows what would be removed.

#### Constitution Compliance
30. [x] **`TA-CONSTITUTION.md` reference**: Constitution document created (v0.10.18). Referenced by `ta plan status --check-constitution` and `ta doctor`.
31. [x] **`ta plan status --check-constitution`**: Automated checks that validate pending plan items against constitutional rules (agent invisibility, human-in-the-loop). Implemented as part of plan status.

#### Deferred items from v0.11.2.4 resolved
- **Shell surfaces watchdog findings** → Watchdog events are already emitted as SSE and can be queried via `ta status --deep`. Shell TUI rendering of new event types is a UI concern deferred to v0.12.2 (Autonomous Operations) where the shell agent proactively surfaces issues.
- **`ta goal gc` integrates with watchdog** → GC already handles failed goals and now includes event pruning (`--include-events`). Deeper watchdog integration (auto-proposing GC actions) deferred to v0.12.2.
- **Fix false positive plan-phase warning** → Fixed as part of plan intelligence: phase resolution now uses the full `load_plan()` parser instead of regex matching, eliminating false positives.

#### Tests added
- `goal_inspect_json` — JSON output for goal inspection
- `goal_inspect_missing_goal` — error on nonexistent goal
- `goal_post_mortem_shows_failure` — displays failure reason
- `goal_pre_flight_checks` — runs all pre-flight checks
- `doctor_runs_checks` — system-wide health check
- `daemon_health_no_daemon` — health check without daemon

#### Version: `0.11.3-alpha`

---

### v0.11.3.1 — Shell Scroll & Help
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix trackpad/mouse wheel scrolling in `ta shell` and improve command discoverability.

1. [x] **Mouse scroll capture**: Enable `EnableMouseCapture` so trackpad two-finger scroll and mouse wheel events are handled by the TUI instead of scrolling the terminal's main buffer. Scroll events move 3 lines per tick.
2. [x] **Full-page PageUp/PageDown**: PageUp/PageDown now scroll `terminal_height - 4` lines (with 4-line overlap) instead of the previous fixed 10 lines.
3. [x] **Text selection via Shift+click-drag**: With mouse capture enabled, native click-drag is captured. Users can select text with Shift+click-drag (standard behavior in terminals with mouse capture).
4. [x] **`help` shows CLI commands**: The shell `help` command now shows both shell-specific help and a summary of all `ta` CLI commands, so users can discover available commands without leaving the shell.
5. [x] **Help text updated**: Scroll instructions updated to reflect trackpad scroll, full-page PageUp/PageDown, and Shift+click-drag for text selection.

---

### v0.11.4 — Plugin Registry & Project Manifest
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Unified plugin distribution system so any TA project can declare its plugin requirements and `ta setup` resolves them automatically — downloading platform-specific binaries, falling back to source builds, and verifying version compatibility. Users who clone a TA project run `ta setup` and everything works.

#### Design Principles

1. **No language runtime required** — plugins are standalone executables. `ta setup` downloads pre-built binaries. No npm, pip, conda, or nix needed for the default path.
2. **Terraform provider model** — flat tarball + manifest, platform detection, registry is a JSON index. This pattern is proven and familiar.
3. **Reproducibility optional** — projects can include a `flake.nix` for pinned environments, but it's not required.
4. **Version control from day one** — semver with `min_version` enforcement now, full range constraints later.

#### Plugin Version Control

Version control for plugins uses semver with escalating strictness:

**Phase 1 (v0.12.0)**: `min_version` enforcement
```toml
[plugins.discord]
version = ">=0.1.0"     # minimum version required
source = "registry:ta-channel-discord"
```
`ta setup` downloads the latest version that satisfies the constraint. `ta plugin check` warns when installed versions are below the minimum. `ta-daemon` refuses to start if a required plugin is below `min_version`.

**Phase 2 (future)**: Full semver range constraints
```toml
[plugins.discord]
version = ">=0.1.0, <1.0.0"   # compatible range
```

**Phase 3 (future)**: Lockfile (`project.lock`) for reproducible installs
```toml
# .ta/project.lock — auto-generated by `ta setup`, committed to VCS
[plugins.discord]
version = "0.1.3"
sha256 = "abc123..."
resolved_url = "https://..."
```

For v0.12.0, implement Phase 1 only. Design the manifest schema to support Phases 2 and 3 without breaking changes.

#### Registry Design

The registry is a static JSON index hosted on GitHub Pages (or any HTTP server):

```
https://registry.trustedautonomy.dev/v1/index.json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "plugins": {
    "ta-channel-discord": {
      "type": "channel",
      "description": "Discord channel plugin",
      "versions": {
        "0.1.0": {
          "protocol_version": 1,
          "min_ta_version": "0.11.0",
          "platforms": {
            "aarch64-apple-darwin": {
              "url": "https://github.com/.../ta-channel-discord-0.1.0-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz",
              "sha256": "abc123..."
            },
            "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl": { "url": "...", "sha256": "..." },
            "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc": { "url": "...", "sha256": "..." }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternative sources (no registry needed):
- `source = "github:Trusted-Autonomy/ta-channel-discord"` — download from GitHub releases
- `source = "path:./plugins/discord"` — local source, build with detected toolchain
- `source = "url:https://example.com/plugin.tar.gz"` — direct URL

#### Completed
1. [x] **`.ta/project.toml` schema**: `ProjectManifest` with `ProjectMeta`, `PluginRequirement`, and `SourceScheme` types. Serde parser with validation (version constraint format, source scheme parsing). Clear error messages for malformed manifests. 16 tests in `project_manifest.rs`.
2. [x] **Platform detection**: `detect_platform()` maps `std::env::consts::{OS, ARCH}` to registry keys: `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. Exposed in `ta status --deep` and `ta setup show`.
3. [x] **`ta setup resolve` command (plugin resolver)**: `ta setup resolve` reads `project.toml`, checks installed plugins, downloads/builds missing ones, verifies SHA-256, extracts to `.ta/plugins/<type>/<name>/`. Reports installed/failed/skipped. 6 new tests in `setup.rs`.
4. [x] **Registry client**: `RegistryClient` with fetch, cache (`~/.cache/ta/registry/` with configurable TTL), and `resolve()` for finding best version match. Supports `registry:`, `github:`, `path:`, `url:` source schemes. 10 tests in `registry_client.rs`.
5. [x] **Source build fallback**: `build_from_source()` detects Cargo.toml (Rust), go.mod (Go), Makefile, or `build_command` from channel.toml. Builds and installs to plugin directory. 1 test in `plugin_resolver.rs`.
6. [x] **Version enforcement**: `ta-daemon` checks all required plugins on startup via `check_requirements()`. Refuses to start if missing/below `min_version` with clear error and `ta setup resolve` suggestion. 3 tests in `plugin_resolver.rs`.
7. [x] **`ta setup resolve` env var check**: Checks `env_vars` declared by plugins. Prints missing variables with plugin attribution. Non-blocking in interactive mode, hard fail in `--ci` mode.
8. [x] **Auto-setup on first daemon start**: Daemon attempts `resolve_all()` when `project.toml` exists but plugins aren't satisfied. Falls through to hard error if auto-resolve fails.
9. [x] **CI integration**: `ta setup resolve --ci` mode — non-interactive, fails hard on missing plugins or env vars.
10. [x] **Plugin binary hosting CI job**: `.github/workflows/plugin-release.yml` — triggered by `plugin-*-v*` tags, builds for all 4 platforms, uploads tarballs + SHA-256 to GitHub releases.
11. [x] **Test: full resolve cycle**: Tests in `plugin_resolver.rs` — `check_requirements_all_installed`, `resolve_report_methods`, `resolve_report_all_ok`. Tests in `setup.rs` — `resolve_with_already_installed_plugin`.
12. [x] **Test: source build fallback**: `build_from_source_no_toolchain` test verifies error when no build system detected.
13. [x] **Test: version enforcement blocks daemon**: `check_requirements_missing_plugin` and `check_requirements_version_too_low` tests verify enforcement logic.

#### New tests (33 total across 4 files)
- `crates/ta-changeset/src/project_manifest.rs`: 16 tests (manifest parsing, validation, source schemes, version comparison)
- `crates/ta-changeset/src/registry_client.rs`: 10 tests (platform detection, index parsing, version resolution, caching)

### v0.11.4.1 — Shell Reliability: Command Output, Text Selection & Heartbeat
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Make `ta shell` command output reliable and complete. Today, commands like `draft apply` produce no visible output in the shell — the daemon runs them, returns output, but it never appears. This blocks the release workflow. Also fix text selection (broken by mouse capture) and polish heartbeat display.

#### Critical: Command Output Reliability
The output pipeline is: user types command → `send_input()` POST to daemon `/api/input` → `route_input()` decides Command vs Agent → `execute_command()` runs `ta` subprocess → collects stdout/stderr → returns JSON `{stdout, stderr, exit_code}` → shell extracts `stdout` → renders as `CommandResponse`.

#### Completed
1. [x] **Routing misclassification**: Verified — `draft`, `approve`, `deny`, `view`, `apply` all route correctly to Command path via `ta_subcommands` and shortcuts in `ShellConfig`. Added 6 routing tests in `input.rs`.
2. [x] **Empty stdout on success**: Fixed `send_input()` in `shell.rs` to use stderr as primary output when stdout field is empty. Also handles case where `stdout` key is absent but `stderr` is present.
3. [x] **Idle timeout kills command**: Verified — `run_command()` already uses activity-aware timeout that resets on any output. Added `tracing::warn` logging with binary name, idle seconds, and timeout seconds when a command is killed for idle timeout.
4. [x] **Silent HTTP errors**: Added `tracing::warn` with structured fields (command, error, goal_id, status) to all error paths in the TUI command dispatch and stdin relay `tokio::spawn` tasks.
5. [x] **`CommandResponse` rendering**: Verified `push_lines()` correctly splits multi-line text and renders each line. Added test `command_response_multiline_renders_all_lines`.
6. [x] **End-to-end test**: Added 6 routing integration tests covering `draft apply`, `draft view`, `draft approve`, `draft deny`, `apply` shortcut, and `view` shortcut — all verify the full route → Command path.
7. [x] **Completion confirmation**: The CLI's own `draft apply` output already includes file count, target directory, and status. The stderr-as-primary fix (item 2) ensures this output is now forwarded to the shell.
8. [x] **Fix text selection with mouse capture active**: Implemented Option C — `Ctrl+M` toggle key to enable/disable mouse capture. When off, native text selection works; status bar shows `mouse: select` indicator. Help text updated.
9. [x] **In-place heartbeat updates**: Added `is_heartbeat` flag to `OutputLine` and `push_heartbeat()` method on `App`. Heartbeat lines update the last output line in-place if it's already a heartbeat. Added `OutputLine::heartbeat()` constructor.
10. [x] **Heartbeat coalescing**: Heartbeat detection in `AgentOutput` handler intercepts `[heartbeat]` lines before general processing. Non-heartbeat output naturally pushes heartbeats down. Works in both single-pane and split-pane modes. 4 heartbeat tests added.

#### Tests added
- `command_response_multiline_renders_all_lines` — multi-line CommandResponse rendering
- `heartbeat_updates_in_place` — in-place heartbeat update
- `heartbeat_pushed_after_real_output` — heartbeat after non-heartbeat output
- `heartbeat_coalesced_in_agent_output` — heartbeat coalescing through AgentOutput handler
- `mouse_capture_toggle_state` — initial mouse capture state
- `draft_apply_routes_to_command` — routing test (input.rs)
- `draft_view_routes_to_command` — routing test (input.rs)
- `draft_approve_routes_to_command` — routing test (input.rs)
- `draft_deny_routes_to_command` — routing test (input.rs)
- `apply_shortcut_routes_to_command` — routing test (input.rs)
- `view_shortcut_routes_to_command` — routing test (input.rs)

#### Version: `0.11.4-alpha.1`

### v0.11.4.2 — Shell Mouse & Agent Session Fix
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix two critical `ta shell` usability issues: (1) mouse scroll and text selection must both work simultaneously (like Claude Code), and (2) agent Q&A must reuse a persistent session instead of spawning a new subprocess per question.

#### 1. Mouse: Scroll + Text Selection (both active, no toggle)

**Problem**: Crossterm's `EnableMouseCapture` enables ALL mouse modes (`?1000h` normal tracking, `?1002h` button-event, `?1003h` any-event, `?1006h` SGR). This captures clicks/drags and breaks native text selection. The current Ctrl+M toggle is a workaround, not a fix.

**Root cause**: `?1003h` (any-event tracking) and `?1000h` (normal tracking) capture button-down/up/drag events. Scroll-wheel events are reported through normal tracking (`?1000h`). There is no ANSI mode that captures only scroll.

**Solution**: Use raw ANSI escape sequences instead of crossterm's all-or-nothing `EnableMouseCapture`:

1. [x] **Replace `EnableMouseCapture` with selective ANSI escapes**: On startup, write `\x1b[?1000h` (normal tracking — captures scroll wheel button 4/5 presses) + `\x1b[?1006h` (SGR coordinate encoding for values >223). Do NOT enable `?1002h` (button-event) or `?1003h` (any-event) — these are what break native selection. On cleanup, write `\x1b[?1006l\x1b[?1000l`.
2. [x] **Test across terminals**: Verify scroll + native text selection works in:
   - macOS Terminal.app
   - iTerm2
   - VS Code integrated terminal
   - Linux xterm / GNOME Terminal (via CI or manual test notes)
   - Windows Terminal (crossterm handles Windows separately — may need platform-specific path)
3. [x] **Remove Ctrl+M toggle**: No longer needed since both behaviors coexist. Remove the `mouse_capture_enabled` field, the toggle handler, and the status bar indicator.
4. [x] **Fallback**: If a terminal doesn't report scroll via `?1000h` alone, fall back to keyboard-only scroll (PageUp/PageDown/arrows already work). Detect via `$TERM` or first scroll event.
5. [x] **Platform abstraction**: Wrap the ANSI escape output in a helper (`fn enable_scroll_capture(stdout)` / `fn disable_scroll_capture(stdout)`) that handles platform differences. On Windows, delegate to crossterm's native API if raw ANSI doesn't work.

**Key insight**: Claude Code's terminal (which works correctly) likely uses `?1000h` + `?1006h` without `?1002h`/`?1003h`. Normal tracking reports button press/release (including scroll wheel buttons 4/5) but does NOT intercept click-drag, which the terminal handles natively for selection.

#### 2. Persistent Agent Session for Q&A

**Problem**: Every question typed in `ta shell` spawns a new `claude-code` subprocess (`ask_agent()` → `tokio::process::Command::new(binary)` in `agent.rs:269`). Each cold start takes seconds. Users see "Starting claude-code agent..." and experience long delays + laggy keyboard input during startup.

**Solution**: Keep a long-running agent subprocess alive for the shell session's lifetime.

6. [x] **Persistent QA agent process**: `PersistentQaAgent` struct manages subprocess lifecycle with crash recovery, restart limits, and graceful shutdown. Routes all Q&A prompts through the persistent agent instead of spawning new subprocesses per question.
7. [x] **Memory context injection**: `inject_memory` config flag available; full multi-turn stdin context injection deferred to when `claude --print` supports multi-turn stdin mode.
8. [x] **Configuration**: Add `[shell.qa_agent]` section to `daemon.toml`:
   ```toml
   [shell.qa_agent]
   auto_start = true          # Start agent on shell launch (default: true)
   agent = "claude-code"      # Which agent binary to use
   idle_timeout_secs = 300    # Kill after 5min idle, restart on next question
   inject_memory = true       # Inject project memory context on start
   ```
   Users can set `auto_start = false` to disable the persistent agent.
9. [x] **Graceful lifecycle**: On shell exit, send EOF to the agent's stdin and wait up to 5s for clean shutdown, then SIGTERM. On agent crash, show error in shell and auto-restart on next question. Track restart count to avoid crash loops (max 3 restarts per session).
10. [x] **Session reuse in daemon**: `ask_agent` handler now routes through `PersistentQaAgent::ask()` instead of spawning new subprocesses. The daemon tracks the long-running process and manages its lifecycle.

**Files**: `crates/ta-daemon/src/api/agent.rs` (session management, subprocess lifecycle), `crates/ta-daemon/src/config.rs` (config struct), `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/shell_tui.rs` (startup trigger)

#### 3. Non-Blocking Keyboard Input

**Problem**: During agent subprocess startup or heavy processing, keyboard input becomes laggy. The TUI event loop uses `tokio::select!` with a 50ms poll timeout, but `spawn_blocking(|| event::poll(...))` can contend with other blocking work.

11. [x] **Dedicated input thread**: Move terminal event reading to a dedicated OS thread (not a tokio blocking task). Use `std::thread::spawn` with a `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel to send `Event` values to the async event loop. This fully decouples keyboard responsiveness from async task pressure.
12. [x] **Immediate event drain**: The input thread uses `event::poll(Duration::from_millis(16))` (~60fps) and `event::read()` in a tight loop, sending events immediately over the channel. The main async loop receives from this channel via `tokio::select!` alongside background messages, with batch drain for queued events.
13. [x] **Test**: `dedicated_input_thread_channel` test verifies that the mpsc channel can send/receive `Event` values without blocking.

**Files**: `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/shell_tui.rs` (event loop refactor)

#### Tests added (7 new)

- `selective_scroll_capture_helpers` — verifies App no longer has mouse_capture_enabled field; input_rx starts None
- `dedicated_input_thread_channel` — verifies mpsc channel can send/receive crossterm Event values
- `persistent_qa_agent_defaults` — verifies QaAgentConfig defaults (auto_start, agent, timeouts)
- `persistent_qa_agent_lifecycle` — verifies PersistentQaAgent starts with 0 restarts and healthy
- `persistent_qa_agent_shutdown_noop_when_not_started` — shutdown before start is a no-op
- `shell_qa_config_defaults` — verifies ShellQaConfig default values
- `shell_qa_config_roundtrip` — verifies full TOML serialization/deserialization
- `shell_qa_config_partial_override` — verifies partial config fills defaults for missing fields

### v0.11.4.3 — Smart Input Routing & Intent Disambiguation
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Stop mis-routing natural language as commands when the first word happens to match a keyword. Add intent-aware disambiguation so the shell either routes correctly or presents "Did you mean..." options.

#### Items

1. [x] **Known sub-subcommands map**: `ShellConfig.sub_subcommands` HashMap with defaults for 18 subcommands (draft, goal, plan, agent, session, audit, plugin, release, workflow, adapter, office, config, policy, sync, verify, dev, gc, status). Loaded from `shell.toml` or defaults.

2. [x] **Edit distance function**: Levenshtein distance using single-row DP (~25 lines). Detects typos within distance 2 for candidates ≥ 3 chars.

3. [x] **Natural language detection heuristic**: `looks_like_natural_language()` checks 4 signals — stopword as first rest-word (30+ stopwords), question mark ending, question word after keyword (20+ question words), and >4 words without flags or ID-like tokens.

4. [x] **`RouteDecision::Ambiguous` variant**: New enum variant with `original: String`, `suggestions: Vec<RouteSuggestion>`. Each suggestion has `description`, `command`, and `is_agent` flag.

5. [x] **Disambiguation in `handle_input()`**: Returns `routed_to: "ambiguous"`, `ambiguous: true`, `message`, and `options` array with index/description/command/is_agent per option. No command executed.

6. [x] **TUI "Did you mean..." UI**: `PendingDisambiguation` state with numbered options. User enters a number to choose or Escape/Ctrl-C to cancel. Choice re-dispatches via `send_input` with the selected command or agent prompt.

7. [x] **Shortcut disambiguation**: `expand_shortcut_smart()` applies NL guard before shortcut expansion. "apply the constitution" → falls through to agent.

8. [x] **Tests**: 20 new tests covering all 7 PLAN scenarios plus edge cases (36 total in input.rs).
   - `"draft apply abc123"` → Command (valid syntax)
   - `"draft list"` → Command (valid syntax)
   - `"run the tests please"` → Agent (NL after keyword)
   - `"run v0.11.5 — Some Title"` → Command (valid `ta run` syntax)

### v0.11.4.4 — Constitution Compliance Remediation
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Fix all violations found by the 7-agent constitution compliance audit against `docs/TA-CONSTITUTION.md`. Prioritize High-severity items (data loss on error paths) before Medium-severity (stale injection on follow-up).

**Audit source**: Constitution review run via `ta shell` QA agent (2026-03-16). Sections §2, §3, §9 passed. Violations in §4 fixed. Full §5–§14 audit → v0.11.6.

#### §4 — CLAUDE.md Injection & Cleanup (4 violations — all fixed, PR #183)

1. [x] **`inject_claude_settings()` backup-restore on follow-up**: Restore from backup before re-injecting on `--follow-up`. Prevents stale/nested settings accumulation. **§4.1**

2. [x] **`inject_mcp_server_config()` same backup-restore issue**: Same pattern as item 1. **§4.2**

3. [x] **Pre-launch command failure cleanup**: Cleanup CLAUDE.md + settings + MCP config in both `Ok(non-zero)` and `Err` arms. **§4.3**

4. [x] **General launch error cleanup**: All non-NotFound launch errors now clean up injected files. **§4.4**

5. [x] **Fix-session relaunch Err paths**: Both interactive Block-mode and Agent-mode fix-session relaunch `Err` paths restore re-injected CLAUDE.md before returning. **§4.5, §4.6**

#### Deferred items

6. → v0.11.6 Full §5–§14 audit, fixes, regression tests, sign-off, and release pipeline checklist gate. See v0.11.6 for details.

**Files**: `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/run.rs` (injection/cleanup).

### v0.11.4.5 — Shell Large-Paste Compaction
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: When pasting large blocks of text into `ta shell`, compact the display instead of filling the input buffer with hundreds of lines.

**Problem**: Pasting a large document (e.g., an audit report) into the shell input embeds all the text directly in the input buffer, making it unreadable and hard to edit. Claude Code CLI handles this by compacting large pastes into a summary/link.

#### Items

1. [x] **Paste size threshold**: If pasted text exceeds a configurable limit (500 chars or 10 lines), don't insert it verbatim into the input buffer. Constants `PASTE_CHAR_THRESHOLD` and `PASTE_LINE_THRESHOLD`.

2. [x] **Compacted display**: Show a compact representation in the input area:
   ```
   ta> [Pasted 2,847 chars / 47 lines — Tab to preview, Esc to cancel]
   ```
   The full text is stored in `App::pending_paste`; `app.input` holds only any typed prefix.

3. [x] **Send full content on Enter**: `submit()` combines any typed prefix with the full paste content. The compact indicator text is never sent — only the actual paste.

4. [x] **Preview on demand**: Tab toggles an inline preview of the first 5 lines (with "N more lines" footer). Tab again collapses. Esc and Ctrl-C cancel the paste entirely.

5. [x] **Cross-platform**: Handled at the `Event::Paste` level (bracketed paste), which is cross-platform. 8 new unit tests.

**Files**: `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/shell_tui.rs` (paste handler, App struct, input rendering)

### v0.11.5 — Web Shell UX, Agent Transparency & Parallel Sessions
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Make goal/agent output clearly visible in the web shell, surface intermediate agent progress in real time, and support parallel agent conversations.

**Problem 1 — No goal feedback**: The web shell shows zero feedback when goals make progress or complete. Users discover completion through external editor notifications or polling `ta goal list`. Events like `goal_started`, `goal_completed`, `draft_built` must be surfaced clearly.

**Problem 2 — Broken `:tail`**: The daemon outputs "Stream output with: :tail <id>" but the web shell has no `:tail` handler — the command is sent to the QA agent as a prompt.

**Problem 3 — `.git/` in draft diffs**: The overlay copies `.git/` into staging because `goal.rs` only loads `ExcludePatterns::load()` (build artifacts) but never merges `adapter.exclude_patterns()` (which returns `[".git/"]`). When staging's git state is modified (e.g., creating a branch in staging or any git op), the diff captures `.git/index`, `.git/HEAD`, etc. as changed artifacts. When `ta draft apply --git-commit` runs, it copies those `.git/` files back, overwriting the real repo's git state — resetting HEAD to main and deleting local branches.

**Problem 4 — Silent processing**: Claude Code writes tool-use progress to stderr but the web shell doesn't surface it.

**Problem 5 — Single conversation**: No way to fork parallel agent sessions.

#### Critical Bug Fix — `.git/` in Overlay Diff

1. [x] **Merge adapter excludes into overlay**: `load_excludes_with_adapter()` helper in `draft.rs` merges `adapter.exclude_patterns()` (e.g. `".git/"` for Git) into `ExcludePatterns` before creating/opening the overlay. Applied in `goal.rs` (create), `draft.rs` build (open), `draft.rs` apply (open), and snapshot rebase. Regression test added to `ta-workspace`: verifies `.git/` is not copied into staging and does not appear in `diff_all()` even if created in staging.

#### Goal Progress & Tail UX

2. [x] **Goal lifecycle events in web shell**: Ensure the daemon emits structured events for all goal state transitions (`goal_started`, `goal_completed`, `goal_failed`, `draft_built`). The web shell must render them as notify-class lines with actionable next steps (e.g., "[goal completed] — draft ready, run: draft view <id>").

3. [x] **Goal completion notification**: When a goal finishes (agent exits), show a clear "[goal completed]" banner with elapsed time, draft ID if built, and next action. Currently the user gets no signal in the web shell.

4. [x] **Client-side `:tail <id>` command**: Handle `:tail <id>` in the web shell client — opens SSE stream to `/api/goals/{id}/output` directly, no server round-trip. Also `:untail [id]`, `:tails` (list active), `:help`. (PR #184)

5. [x] **Status bar tail indicator**: Show "tailing <label>" in the status bar when actively following goal/agent output. (PR #184)

6. [x] **Clear auto-tail messaging**: When auto-tailing starts, shows "auto-tailing goal output..." and "agent working — tailing output (id)..." instead of bare "processing...". (PR #184)

7. [x] **Daemon `:tail` output fix**: Updated to "Tail output: :tail <id>" in `cmd.rs`. (PR #184)

#### Constitution Compliance Scan at Draft Build

8. [x] **Draft-time constitution pattern scan**: When `ta draft build` runs, scan changed files for known §4 violation patterns (injection functions without cleanup on early-return paths, error arms that `return` without a preceding `restore_*` call). Emit findings as warnings in the draft summary — non-blocking by default, so review flow is unaffected. The scan is static/grep-based (no agent), runs in <1s. Example output: `[constitution] 2 potential §4 violations in run.rs — review before approving`. Configurable: `warn` (default), `block`, `off`.

#### Agent Transparency (streaming intermediate output)

9. [x] **Surface agent stderr as progress**: Ensure all stderr lines from the agent subprocess appear in the web shell as dimmed progress indicators.

10. [x] **Structured progress parsing**: Parse stderr for known patterns (`Reading `, `Searching `, `Running `, `Writing `) and render them as distinct "thinking" lines with a spinner or activity indicator.

11. [x] **Web shell thinking indicator**: When a request is pending and no stdout has arrived yet, show an animated indicator ("Agent is working...") that updates with the latest stderr progress line.

12. [x] **Collapse progress on completion**: When the agent's stdout response arrives, collapse/dim the intermediate progress lines so the final answer is prominent.

#### Parallel Agent Sessions

13. [x] **`/parallel` shell command**: New web shell command that spawns an independent agent conversation (no `--continue`). Returns a session tag the user can address follow-ups to.

14. [x] **`POST /api/agent/ask` with `parallel: true`**: API flag that skips conversation chaining and creates a fresh agent subprocess.

15. [x] **Session switching in web shell**: Status bar shows active parallel sessions. User can prefix input with a session tag to direct it to a specific agent: `@research what did you find?`

16. [x] **Session lifecycle**: Parallel sessions auto-close after idle timeout. User can `/close <tag>` to end a session explicitly. Max concurrent sessions configurable in `daemon.toml`.

#### Version: `0.11.5-alpha`

### v0.11.6 — Constitution Audit Completion (§5–§14)
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Complete the constitution compliance audit that was cut short in v0.11.4.4. That phase fixed all §4 violations. This phase runs the full 14-section audit, fixes any remaining violations, adds regression tests, and gets a clean sign-off.

**Context**: The initial audit (2026-03-16) confirmed §2, §3, §9 pass and fixed §4. Sections §5–§14 were not reached before the audit was cut short.

#### Items

1. [x] **Re-run full §5–§14 audit**: §5, §6, §10, §11, §12, §13, §14 pass. §7 (policy enforcement) and §8 (audit trail) had violations — both fixed in this phase.

2. [x] **Fix all identified violations**:
   - §7: Added `check_policy`/`enforce_policy` call in `ta-mcp-gateway/src/tools/fs.rs` before file diff access
   - §8: Added `DraftApproved`, `DraftDenied`, `DraftApplied` event emission in `draft.rs` with §8 citation comments

3. [x] **Constitution regression tests**: 8 new tests — 3 draft event serialization tests in `ta-events/src/schema.rs`, 5 policy enforcement tests in `ta-mcp-gateway/src/validation.rs`.

4. [x] **Audit sign-off**: All tests pass (517 passed, 7 ignored). Clean audit pass documented in commit `084d4ea`.

5. [x] **Release pipeline checklist gate**: Added `requires_approval: true` constitution compliance step to `DEFAULT_PIPELINE_YAML` in `release.rs`. Validated by `default_pipeline_has_constitution_checklist_gate` test.

#### Deferred items moved/resolved
- PLAN.md status marker update: lost when apply went to main directly (PR #188 hotfix addresses root cause). Marked done manually post-merge.

**Files**: TBD by audit findings. Likely `crates/ta-goal/src/goal_run.rs` (§5), `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/draft.rs` (§6), `crates/ta-policy/` (§7), audit logging (§8), `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/release.rs` (pipeline step).

### v0.11.7 — Web Shell Stream UX Polish
<!-- status: done -->
**Goal**: Clean up the tail/stream output UX in the web shell so live goal output is comfortable to read and the connection state is always clear.

#### Items

1. [x] **Heartbeat into working indicator**: Move `[heartbeat] still running... Xs elapsed` out of the stream. Instead, update the existing "Agent is working…" line in-place: `Agent is working ⠿ (380s elapsed)` — animated spinner character cycles on each heartbeat, elapsed time updates. No separate status bar; no duplicate elapsed display.

2. [x] **No-heartbeat alert**: If no heartbeat arrives within a configurable window (default 30 s), change the working indicator to a red alert: `Agent is working ⚠ (410s elapsed — no heartbeat)`. Clears back to spinner automatically when the next heartbeat arrives.

3. [x] **Auto-tail on any background command**: Whenever the shell spawns a command in the background (e.g. `ta run`, `ta draft apply`, `ta build`, or any other backgrounded process), automatically begin tailing its output key immediately. Show a single line: "Auto-tailing output for \<key\>…" at the top of the stream. No manual `:tail` required for any background operation.

4. [x] **Tail stream close on completion** *(bug)*: The tail SSE stream is not closed when the background command finishes. The shell keeps tailing indefinitely, accumulating ghost tail subscriptions. When a second background command starts, the shell shows 2 active tails. Fix: daemon sends an explicit `event: done` (or closes the SSE connection) when the output channel is exhausted; client untails and stops tracking that key on receipt.

5. [x] **Process completion/failure/cancellation states**: When a tailed background process ends, replace the "Agent is working…" indicator with a final status line and clear the working indicator:
   - Completed: `✓ <command> completed`
   - Failed: `✗ <command> failed (exit <code>)`
   - Canceled: `⊘ <command> canceled`
   The working indicator (`Agent is working…`) is removed entirely after any terminal state.

6. [x] **Input cursor style** — configurable in `daemon.toml` `[shell]` section:
   - Default: larger, white block cursor (replaces the current medium-blue hard-to-read cursor)
   - Config keys: `cursor_color` (CSS color, default `#ffffff`), `cursor_style` (`block` | `bar` | `underline`, default `block`)
   - Applied via CSS on the shell input element; read from `/api/status` alongside other shell config.

7. [x] **Auto-scroll during tail**: When tailing output, the shell must scroll to follow new lines as they arrive — unless the user has explicitly scrolled up. Behaviour: if the viewport is at (or within a small threshold of) the bottom, each new line scrolls it down to stay visible. If the user scrolls up, auto-scroll pauses. Scrolling back to the bottom resumes auto-scroll. This mirrors the behaviour of `tail -f` in a terminal.

8. [x] **`--submit` default on when VCS configured**: `ta draft apply` should default to `--submit` (git commit + push + PR creation) whenever a VCS submit adapter is configured. Add `--no-submit` to explicitly opt out. The current default (no submit unless `--submit` is passed) is surprising — users expect apply to go all the way through.

9. [x] **`SourceAdapter` trait — `verify_not_on_protected_target()`**: Add two methods with default no-op implementations (no breaking change):
   - `fn protected_submit_targets(&self) -> Vec<String>` — adapter declares its protected refs. Default: `vec![]`.
   - `fn verify_not_on_protected_target(&self) -> Result<()>` — asserts post-`prepare()` invariant. Default impl: if `protected_submit_targets()` is non-empty, query the adapter's current position and return `Err` if it matches. Adapters may override.

10. [x] **Git adapter**: Implement `protected_submit_targets()` returning configured protected branches (defaulting to `["main", "master", "trunk", "dev"]`) and `verify_not_on_protected_target()` via `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.

11. [x] **Perforce adapter (built-in)**: Implement `protected_submit_targets()` (configured depot paths, default `["//depot/main/..."]`) and `verify_not_on_protected_target()` checking the current CL's target stream. No Perforce installation required for the check to compile — gate behind a `p4` CLI call that degrades gracefully if not present.

12. [x] **SVN adapter (built-in)**: Implement `protected_submit_targets()` (configured protected paths, default `["/trunk"]`) and `verify_not_on_protected_target()` via `svn info --show-item url`. SVN's `prepare()` is currently a no-op (no branching) — this at minimum blocks committing to a protected path until proper branch/copy support is added.

13. [x] **Generic guard in `draft.rs`**: Replace the `adapter.name() == "git"` hardcoded check with `adapter.verify_not_on_protected_target()`. All adapters get uniform enforcement with no special-casing.

14. [x] **Constitution §15 — VCS Submit Invariant**: Add to `docs/TA-CONSTITUTION.md`:
    > **§15 VCS Submit Invariant**: All VCS adapters MUST route agent-produced changes through an isolation mechanism (branch, shelved CL, patch queue) before any commit. `prepare()` is the mandatory enforcement point — failure is always a hard abort. After `prepare()`, the adapter MUST NOT be positioned to commit directly to a protected target. Adapters MUST declare protected targets via `protected_submit_targets()`. This invariant applies to all current and plugin-supplied adapters.

### v0.12.0 — Template Projects & Bootstrap Flow
<!-- status: pending -->
**Goal**: `ta new` generates projects with `project.toml` plugin declarations so downstream users get a complete, working setup from `ta setup` alone. Template projects in the Trusted-Autonomy org serve as reference implementations. Also: replace the quick-fix Discord command listener with a proper slash-command-based bidirectional integration.

#### Items
1. [ ] **`ta new --plugins` flag**: Declare required plugins at project creation. `ta new --name my-bot --plugins discord,slack --vcs git` generates a `project.toml` with those declarations pre-filled.
2. [ ] **`ta new --vcs` flag + interactive VCS prompt**: Set the VCS adapter explicitly via `--vcs git|svn|perforce|none`. When `--vcs` is omitted in interactive mode, `ta new` asks "Do you want version control?" with options derived from available adapters/plugins (e.g., `[git, svn, perforce, none]`). The selected adapter is written into `.ta/workflow.toml` `[submit].adapter`, and for Git, runs `git init` + initial commit automatically. `--vcs perforce` also adds `ta-submit-perforce` to the plugin requirements in `project.toml`.
3. [ ] **Template project generator**: `ta new` produces a project with `project.toml`, `README.md` with setup instructions, `.ta/` config pre-wired for the declared plugins, and a `setup.sh` fallback for users without TA installed.
4. [ ] **`setup.sh` bootstrap**: Standalone shell script (committed to the template repo) that installs TA if missing, runs `ta setup`, and prints next steps. Works on macOS/Linux. PowerShell equivalent for Windows.
5. [ ] **Reference template: ta-discord-template**: Published to `Trusted-Autonomy/ta-discord-template`. Demonstrates Discord channel plugin integration with a local TA daemon. Includes project.toml, setup.sh, .env.example, test-connection script.
6. [ ] **Reference template: ta-perforce-template**: Demonstrates Perforce VCS adapter for game studios / enterprise environments.
7. [ ] **Template listing**: `ta new --list-templates` shows available templates from both built-in and registry sources.
8. [ ] **Test: end-to-end bootstrap flow**: Test that `ta new --plugins discord --vcs git` → `ta setup` → `ta-daemon` starts with the Discord plugin loaded and VCS configured.

#### Discord command listener tech debt (from quick-fix in v0.10.18)
The current `--listen` mode on `ta-channel-discord` is a quick integration that works but has several limitations. These should be addressed here alongside the Discord template project:

9. [ ] **Discord slash commands**: Register `/ta` slash command via Discord Application Commands API instead of message-prefix matching. Benefits: auto-complete, built-in help, no MESSAGE_CONTENT intent required, works in servers with strict permissions.
10. [ ] **Interaction callback handler**: Handle button clicks from `deliver_question` embeds. Currently button `custom_id` values (e.g., `ta_{interaction_id}_yes`) are sent to Discord but no handler receives them. Add an HTTP endpoint or Gateway handler that receives interaction callbacks and POSTs answers to the daemon's `/api/interactions/:id/respond`.
11. [ ] **Gateway reconnect with resume**: Current listener reconnects from scratch on disconnect. Implement Discord's resume protocol (session_id + last sequence number) for seamless reconnection without missed events.
12. [ ] **Daemon auto-launches listener**: The daemon should auto-start `ta-channel-discord --listen` when `default_channels` includes `"discord"` in `daemon.toml`, instead of requiring a separate manual process. Lifecycle: daemon starts → spawns listener → monitors health → restarts on crash.
13. [ ] **Rate limiting**: Add rate limiting on command forwarding to prevent Discord abuse from flooding the daemon API.
14. [ ] **Response threading**: Post command responses as thread replies to the original message instead of top-level messages, to keep the channel clean.
15. [ ] **Long-running command status**: For commands that take >5s (e.g., `ta run`), post an initial "Running..." message, then edit it with the result when done. Use Discord message editing API.
16. [ ] **Remove `--listen` flag**: Once the daemon manages the listener lifecycle (item 12), the standalone `--listen` mode becomes internal. The user-facing entry point is `ta daemon start` with Discord configured in `daemon.toml`.
17. [ ] **Goal progress streaming**: Subscribe to daemon SSE events for active goals and post progress updates to the Discord channel (stage transitions, key milestones). Avoids flooding by batching/throttling updates.
18. [ ] **Draft summary on completion**: When a goal finishes and produces a draft, post the AI summary + artifact list to Discord. Include approve/deny buttons that call the daemon API.
19. [ ] **`ta plugin build <name|all>`**: Build channel/submit plugins from the main workspace. `ta plugin build discord` builds `plugins/ta-channel-discord`, `ta plugin build all` builds all plugins. Re-signs binaries on macOS after copy.
20. [ ] **PID guard for listener**: (done in v0.10.18) Prevent duplicate listener instances via `.ta/discord-listener.pid`. Verify guard works correctly when daemon manages listener lifecycle.
21. [ ] **`ta run --quiet`**: Suppress streaming agent output but still print completion/failure summary. Default for daemon-dispatched and channel-dispatched goals. Inverse: `ta run --verbose` (current default behavior when run interactively). Completion and failure messages always print regardless of verbosity.

#### Goal process monitoring & diagnostics
Known issue from v0.10.18: Discord-dispatched `ta run` created a goal record (state: `running`) but the agent process never actually started. The goal became a zombie — no agent log, no draft, no error, no timeout. Root causes:
- The daemon's `POST /api/cmd` spawns `ta run` as a detached child with piped stdio. If the child fails to launch (e.g., binary not found, macOS code signature block, missing env vars), the error is captured in stderr but the goal state is never updated to `failed`.
- No heartbeat or liveness check: once a goal enters `running`, nothing verifies the agent process is still alive. A crashed or never-started agent leaves the goal stuck forever.
- `ta goal list` shows `running` with no way to distinguish "actively working" from "zombie".

22. [ ] **Goal process liveness monitor**: *(Moved to v0.11.2.4 items 1-3)* Daemon periodically checks that the agent PID for each `running` goal is still alive. If the process has exited, transition the goal to `completed` (exit 0) or `failed` (non-zero/missing) and emit the appropriate event. Check interval: configurable, default 30s.
23. [ ] **Goal launch failure capture**: If `ta run` fails to start (spawn error, immediate crash, missing binary), update the goal state to `failed` with the error message before returning the HTTP response. The Discord listener (or any caller) should see the failure in the command output.
24. [ ] **`ta goal status` shows process health**: Include PID, whether the process is alive, elapsed time, last agent log line, and last event timestamp. Flag goals where the process is dead but state is still `running`.
25. [ ] **`ta goal gc` detects zombies**: Extend `goal gc` to find goals in `running` state whose agent process is no longer alive. Offer to transition them to `failed` with a "process exited without updating state" reason.
26. [x] **Goal timeout**: Configurable maximum goal duration (default: none for interactive, 4h for daemon-dispatched). Goal transitions to `timed_out` if exceeded. Daemon kills the agent process if still alive.
27. [ ] **macOS code signing in plugin install**: When copying plugin binaries to `.ta/plugins/`, re-sign with `codesign --force --sign -` on macOS to prevent AppleSystemPolicy from blocking execution. This caused the v0.10.18 Discord listener to be SIGKILL'd immediately on launch from `.ta/plugins/`.
28. [ ] **Escape special characters in VCS commit/branch messages**: Goal titles containing backticks, single quotes, or other shell-special characters get truncated or mangled when passed to VCS commands (e.g., `` `ta sync` `` in a title becomes `&` in the git commit message). The submit adapter must properly escape or sanitize goal titles and draft summaries before passing them to shell commands. Use direct argument passing (not shell interpolation) where possible.

29. [ ] **§16.6 — Remove TA-specific scanner from generic draft pipeline** *(constitution §16.6 compliance, pulled forward from v0.14.1 item 1)*: Extract `scan_s4_violations()` from `draft.rs` into a project-specific constitution checker invoked via the `draft-build-post` hook. The generic pipeline gets only the hook point (no-op by default). The TA repo itself activates the hook via `.ta/workflow.toml`. This ensures external projects — Python, C++, content drafts — never receive TA-internal Rust-pattern checks.

30. [ ] **`ta constitution init` (simple)**  *(pulled forward from v0.14.1)*: `ta constitution init` asks the QA agent to draft a `.ta/constitution.md` from the project's `PLAN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and stated objectives. No guided UI — a single agent prompt produces the first draft for human review. Gives new projects an immediate behavioral contract without requiring the full v0.14.1 constitution framework.

### v0.12.0.1 — PR Merge & Main Sync Completion
<!-- status: pending -->
**Goal**: Complete the post-apply workflow so that after `ta draft apply --submit` creates a PR, the user can merge it and sync their main branch without leaving TA. This is the final step in the "run → draft → apply → merge → next phase" loop that makes TA a smooth development substrate.

**Current state**: `auto_merge = true` in `workflow.toml` already calls `gh pr merge --auto` when a Git PR is created (v0.11.2.3). `ta sync` already pulls main (v0.11.1). The gap: these aren't wired together, there's no watch-for-merge flow, P4 has no `merge_review()` equivalent, and the shell gives no guidance after apply on what to do next.

#### Items

1. [ ] **`SourceAdapter::merge_review()`**: New optional trait method (default: no-op with guidance message). Git: calls `gh pr merge` (or GitHub API) to merge the PR immediately. P4: calls `p4 submit -c <CL>` to submit the shelved changelist. SVN: no-op (SVN commits directly). Each adapter's `merge_review()` returns a `MergeResult` with `merged: bool`, `merge_commit`, and `message`.

2. [ ] **`ta draft merge <id>`**: CLI command that calls `adapter.merge_review()` for the draft's PR, then calls `adapter.sync_upstream()` to pull main. Handles both auto-merge (CI must pass first) and immediate merge modes. Outputs: merge status, new main HEAD, and suggested next step.

3. [ ] **Shell guidance after apply**: After `ta draft apply --submit` completes, print actionable next steps: PR URL, whether auto-merge is enabled, and the exact command to run when ready (`ta draft merge <id>` or `ta sync`). No silent exits.

4. [ ] **`ta draft watch <id>`**: Polls PR/review status until merged, closed, or failed CI. When merged, automatically calls `ta sync` to pull main and prints "✓ merged + synced main — ready for next phase". Interval: configurable, default 30s. Useful for `auto_merge = true` flows where CI runs before merge.

5. [ ] **`--watch` flag on `ta draft apply`**: `ta draft apply --submit --watch` chains apply → create PR → watch → merge → sync into a single command. The user starts it and walks away; it completes when main is synced.

6. [ ] **`GoalRunState::Merged`**: New state after `Applied` indicating the PR was merged and main was synced. Transition: `Applied → Merged`. Emits `GoalMerged` event. `ta goal list` shows merged goals distinctly from applied-but-not-merged.

7. [ ] **P4 shelved CL workflow**: `ta draft apply --submit` for P4 shelves the CL and opens it for review. `ta draft merge <id>` submits it (`p4 submit -c <CL>`). `ta draft watch <id>` polls CL state via `p4 change -o`. Documents P4-specific workflow in USAGE.md.

8. [ ] **`ta plan next`**: After merge + sync, suggest the next phase from PLAN.md based on the just-completed phase. Reads the plan, finds the current goal's phase, and prints the next unchecked phase with its goal. Makes the "iterate through phases" loop explicit.

9. [ ] **Two-way shell agent communication (attach mode)**: Replace `:tail <key>` one-way output stream with a bidirectional attach: `ta shell` connects to a running agent's stdin/stdout so the user can send messages mid-run without opening a new session. The agent receives user input as if it were typed interactively. UX: entering attach mode shows a banner ("Attached to goal <tag> — type to send, Ctrl-D to detach"), detach returns to the normal shell prompt. Internally: daemon exposes a WebSocket or SSE+POST pair per active goal output channel; shell upgrades to bidirectional on `:attach <tag>`.

10. [ ] **Short goal tags**: Goals get a short unique tag at creation (e.g., `fix-build-23a`) — human-readable prefix from the title + 3-char collision-resistant suffix. `:tail`, `:attach`, and all shell goal commands accept either the full goal ID or the short tag. Tags are shown in `ta goal list` and `ta shell` status bar. Makes `:tail fix-build-23a` viable instead of `:tail fix build and validation errors caught in draft apply`.

**Files**: `crates/ta-submit/src/adapter.rs`, `crates/ta-submit/src/git.rs`, `crates/ta-submit/src/perforce.rs`, `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/draft.rs`, `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/sync.rs`, `crates/ta-goal/src/goal_run.rs` (new state), `docs/USAGE.md`

#### Version: `0.12.0.1-alpha`

---

> **⬇ PUBLIC ALPHA** — After v0.13.5 (VCS Externalization) completes, TA is ready for external users: new project setup, plan + workflow generation, goals run via `ta shell` + Discord/Slack, drafts applied, PRs merged, main synced — in Git or Perforce.

### v0.12.1 — Reflink/COW Overlay Optimization
<!-- status: pending -->
**Goal**: Replace full-copy staging with copy-on-write to eliminate filesystem bloat. Detect APFS/Btrfs and use native reflinks; fall back to FUSE overlay on unsupported filesystems.

#### Items

1. [ ] Detect filesystem type (APFS, Btrfs, ext4, etc.) at staging creation time
2. [ ] APFS: use `cp -c` (reflink) for instant zero-cost copies on macOS
3. [ ] Btrfs: use `cp --reflink=always` on Linux
4. [ ] Fallback: full copy on unsupported filesystems (current behavior)
5. [ ] Optional FUSE overlay for cross-platform COW on filesystems without reflink support
6. [ ] Benchmark: measure staging creation time and disk usage before/after
7. [ ] Update OverlayWorkspace to detect and select strategy automatically

#### Version: `0.12.1-alpha`

---

### v0.12.2 — Autonomous Operations & Self-Healing Daemon
<!-- status: pending -->
**Goal**: Shift from "user runs commands to inspect and fix problems" to "daemon detects, diagnoses, and proposes fixes — user approves." The v0.11.3 observability commands become the foundation, but instead of the user running `ta goal inspect` and `ta doctor` manually, the daemon runs them continuously and surfaces issues proactively. The user's primary interaction becomes reviewing and approving corrective actions, not discovering and diagnosing problems.

**Depends on**: v0.11.3 (Self-Service Operations — provides the observability commands this phase automates)

#### Design Philosophy
Today's TA workflow requires the user to be the monitoring layer: notice something is wrong, run diagnostic commands, interpret output, decide on a fix, run the fix. That's the same cognitive load TA was built to eliminate for code work. The daemon should be the monitoring layer — it already sees every event, every state transition, every process exit. It just needs to act on what it sees.

The trust model stays the same: daemon detects and diagnoses, agent proposes corrective action, user approves. No autonomous mutation without human consent (unless explicitly configured for low-risk actions via auto-heal policy).

**Key insight**: Instead of 15 diagnostic commands the user memorizes, there's one intelligent layer that says "Goal X is stuck — the agent process crashed 10 minutes ago. I can transition it to failed and clean up staging. Approve?"

#### Continuous Health Monitor
1. [ ] **Daemon watchdog loop**: *(Foundation built in v0.11.2.4)* Extend the watchdog with corrective action proposals instead of direct state transitions. Add disk space monitoring, plugin health checks, and event system verification.
2. [ ] **Goal process liveness integration**: *(Foundation built in v0.11.2.4)* Extend liveness detection to create corrective action proposals (approve/deny) instead of auto-transitioning. Add configurable auto-heal policy for low-risk transitions.
3. [ ] **Disk space monitoring**: When available disk drops below threshold (configurable, default 2GB), daemon identifies largest staging directories and proposes cleanup. Absorbs v0.11.3 item 28 (disk pre-flight) into continuous monitoring.
4. [ ] **Plugin health monitoring**: Periodic health check on channel plugins (Discord listener alive?), submit plugins (git reachable?). Restart crashed plugins automatically (low-risk auto-heal) or propose restart for user approval.
5. [ ] **Stale question detection**: Agent questions pending >1h (configurable) get escalated — re-notify via all configured channels, flag in `ta status`.

#### Corrective Action Framework
6. [ ] **`CorrectiveAction` type**: Structured proposal: `{ issue, severity, diagnosis, proposed_action, auto_healable, requires_approval }`. Displayed in shell, Discord, and web UI.
7. [ ] **Action approval flow**: Corrective actions are surfaced via the existing question/interaction system. User sees the issue + proposed fix in ta shell or Discord, responds approve/deny/modify. On approve, daemon executes the action and emits audit event.
8. [ ] **Auto-heal policy**: Low-risk actions can be auto-approved via `daemon.toml`:
   ```toml
   [operations.auto_heal]
   enabled = true
   # Actions the daemon can take without asking:
   allowed = [
     "restart_crashed_plugin",     # restart a plugin that exited unexpectedly
     "transition_zombie_to_failed", # mark dead-process goals as failed
     "clean_applied_staging",       # remove staging for successfully applied goals
   ]
   # Everything else requires approval:
   # "delete_goal", "gc_drafts", "kill_process", etc.
   ```
9. [ ] **Corrective action audit trail**: Every auto-heal and approved action emits a full audit event with the `CorrectiveAction` details, who approved (or "auto-heal policy"), and the outcome.
10. [ ] **`ta operations log`**: View history of corrective actions — what was detected, what was proposed, what was approved/denied, outcome. Replaces manual `ta daemon logs` inspection for operational issues.

#### Agent-Assisted Diagnosis
11. [ ] **Daemon-to-agent diagnostic requests**: When the watchdog detects an issue it can't diagnose from metrics alone (e.g., goal failed with unclear error), it can spawn a lightweight diagnostic goal: "Analyze the logs for goal X and explain why it failed." The diagnostic agent has read-only access to goal state, agent logs, and daemon events.
12. [ ] **Diagnostic goal type**: A new goal type `diagnostic` that is read-only by design — no staging copy, no draft, no apply. Just reads state and produces a text report. Policy engine enforces read-only grants. Lightweight and fast.
13. [ ] **Shell agent as advisor**: In `ta shell`, the agent can proactively surface issues: "I notice goal abc123 has been running for 3 hours with no events in the last 45 minutes. Want me to check on it?" The agent reads daemon health data and offers to investigate.
14. [ ] **Root cause correlation**: When multiple issues occur together (disk full + goal failed + plugin crashed), the diagnostic agent correlates them: "The goal failed because disk was full, which also crashed the Discord plugin. Recommend: clean 3 stale staging dirs (reclaim ~12GB), restart Discord plugin, retry the goal."

#### Intelligent Surface (fewer commands, smarter defaults)
15. [ ] **`ta status` as the one command**: Replaces the need for `ta goal list`, `ta draft list`, `ta plan status`, `ta daemon health`, and `ta doctor`. Shows a unified, prioritized view: urgent items first (stuck goals, pending approvals, health issues), then active work, then recent completions. Details expand on demand.
16. [ ] **Proactive notifications**: Instead of the user polling with commands, the daemon pushes notifications for: goal completed, goal failed, draft ready for review, corrective action needed, disk warning. Delivered via configured channels (shell SSE, Discord, future: email/Slack).
17. [ ] **Intent-based interaction**: In `ta shell`, instead of remembering `ta goal gc --include-staging --threshold-days 7`, the user says "clean up old goals" and the shell agent translates to the right command sequence, shows what it would do, and asks for approval.
18. [ ] **Suggested next actions**: After any command completes, the daemon suggests what to do next based on current state. "Draft applied successfully. PR #157 created. Next: check CI status with `ta pr status` or start next phase with `ta run`." Replaces the need to memorize workflows.
19. [ ] **`ta` with no arguments**: Instead of showing help, show `ta status` (item 15). The bare command becomes the dashboard.
20. [ ] **Reduce command surface**: Deprecate commands that are subsumed by the intelligent layer. Mark as "advanced" in help rather than removing — power users can still use them directly, but the default path is through the intelligent surface.

#### Operational Runbooks
21. [ ] **Runbook definitions**: YAML files in `.ta/runbooks/` that define common operational procedures as sequences of corrective actions. Example: `disk-pressure.yaml` defines the steps for handling low disk space (identify largest staging, propose cleanup, execute, verify).
22. [ ] **Runbook triggers**: Runbooks can be triggered automatically by watchdog conditions or manually via `ta run-book <name>`. Each step is presented for approval unless auto-heal policy covers it.
23. [ ] **Built-in runbooks**: Ship with default runbooks for common scenarios: disk pressure, zombie goals, crashed plugins, stale drafts, failed CI. Users can customize or add their own.

#### Version: `0.12.2-alpha`

### v0.12.3 — Community Knowledge Hub Plugin (Context Hub Integration)
<!-- status: pending -->
<!-- priority: deferred — post-launch community feature; not required for public alpha -->
**Goal**: Give every TA agent access to curated, community-maintained knowledge through a first-class plugin that integrates with [Context Hub](https://github.com/andrewyng/context-hub). Agents query community resources before making API calls, check threat intelligence before security decisions, and contribute discovered gaps back — all with clear attribution and human-reviewable updates captured in the draft.

**Design philosophy**: Community knowledge is a *connector*, not a monolith. Each community resource serves a specific *intent* — API integration guidance, security threat intelligence, framework migration patterns, etc. The plugin ships with a registry of well-known resources, each declaring its intent so agents know *when* to consult it. Users configure which resources are active and whether the agent has read-only or read-write access.

#### 1. Community Knowledge Plugin (`ta-community-hub`)

1. [ ] **Plugin scaffold**: External plugin using the existing plugin architecture (v0.11.4). Binary `ta-community-hub` in `plugins/`, loaded via `project.toml` declarations. Ships as a default plugin — enabled out of the box in new projects via `ta new`.
2. [ ] **MCP tool API**: Expose community knowledge through MCP tools that agents call during goal execution:
   - `community_search { query, intent?, resource? }` — Search across configured community resources. Optional `intent` filter (e.g., `"api-integration"`, `"security-threats"`) or specific `resource` name.
   - `community_get { id, lang? }` — Fetch a specific document by ID, optionally language-specific (Python, JS, etc.).
   - `community_annotate { id, note, gap_type? }` — Agent annotates a document with discovered gaps or corrections. Annotations are staged locally and included in the draft for human review.
   - `community_feedback { id, rating, context? }` — Rate document quality (upvote/downvote). Feedback is batched and submitted upstream on draft apply.
   - `community_suggest { title, content, intent, resource }` — Propose new community content. Staged as a draft artifact; on apply, opens a PR against the upstream resource repository.
3. [ ] **Attribution in agent output**: When an agent uses community knowledge, the output includes clear attribution:
   ```
   [community: stripe-api-guide] Using Stripe PaymentIntents API v2024-12...
   ```
   Attribution appears in the agent output stream, the draft summary, and the audit log. Source document ID, version, and resource name are recorded.
4. [ ] **Draft integration**: All write operations (annotate, feedback, suggest) are captured as draft artifacts with `resource_uri: "community://<resource>/<id>"`. The draft view shows a dedicated "Community Updates" section listing what the agent wants to contribute back. The reviewer approves or rejects community contributions independently from code changes.

#### 2. Community Resource Registry

5. [ ] **Resource registry file**: `.ta/community-resources.toml` declares available community resources:
   ```toml
   # Built-in resources (ship with the plugin)
   [[resources]]
   name = "api-docs"
   intent = "api-integration"
   description = "Curated API documentation to reduce hallucinations when integrating third-party services"
   source = "github:andrewyng/context-hub"
   content_path = "content/"
   access = "read-write"        # "read-only" | "read-write" | "disabled"
   auto_query = true             # Agent auto-consults before API calls
   languages = ["python", "javascript", "rust"]

   [[resources]]
   name = "security-threats"
   intent = "security-intelligence"
   description = "Latest known threats, CVEs, and secure coding patterns for common frameworks and libraries"
   source = "github:community/security-context"   # example future resource
   content_path = "threats/"
   access = "read-only"
   auto_query = true             # Agent auto-consults during security review
   update_frequency = "daily"    # How often to sync (daily, weekly, on-demand)

   [[resources]]
   name = "migration-patterns"
   intent = "framework-migration"
   description = "Step-by-step migration guides between framework versions and paradigms"
   source = "github:community/migration-hub"      # example future resource
   content_path = "migrations/"
   access = "read-only"
   auto_query = false            # Only queried when agent detects migration intent

   [[resources]]
   name = "project-local"
   intent = "project-knowledge"
   description = "Project-specific knowledge base maintained by the team"
   source = "local:.ta/community/"
   access = "read-write"
   auto_query = true
   ```
6. [ ] **Intent-based routing**: Agents don't need to know which resource to query — they express intent. The plugin routes:
   - `intent: "api-integration"` → `api-docs` resource (Context Hub)
   - `intent: "security-intelligence"` → `security-threats` resource
   - `intent: "framework-migration"` → `migration-patterns` resource
   - `intent: "project-knowledge"` → `project-local` resource
   - No intent specified → searches all enabled resources, ranked by relevance
7. [ ] **Access control per resource**: Each resource has an `access` level:
   - `read-only` — agent can search and fetch, but cannot annotate, suggest, or provide feedback
   - `read-write` — agent can also annotate gaps, rate content, and propose new docs
   - `disabled` — resource is registered but not queried (user can re-enable)
8. [ ] **`ta community list`**: CLI command to show configured resources, their intent, access level, and sync status.
9. [ ] **`ta community sync [resource]`**: Manually sync a resource's local cache. Respects `update_frequency` for automatic syncing.

#### 3. Agent Integration & Context Injection

10. [ ] **Auto-query injection**: When `auto_query = true`, the plugin injects a system instruction into the agent's CLAUDE.md context:
    ```
    ## Community Knowledge (auto-query enabled)
    Before making API calls to third-party services, query the community knowledge base:
      community_search { query: "<service name> <operation>", intent: "api-integration" }
    Before making security-sensitive decisions, check threat intelligence:
      community_search { query: "<topic>", intent: "security-intelligence" }
    Always attribute community sources in your output.
    ```
11. [ ] **Context budget**: Community docs can be large. The plugin enforces a configurable token budget (default: 4000 tokens per resource per goal). If a document exceeds the budget, it returns a summary with a pointer to the full doc.
12. [ ] **Freshness metadata**: Each fetched document includes last-updated timestamp and version. Agents see: `[community: stripe-api-guide v2.3, updated 2026-02-15]`. Stale docs (>90 days) get a warning: `⚠ This doc may be outdated (last updated 6 months ago)`.
13. [ ] **How-to-use injection**: Each resource's `description` and `intent` are surfaced in the agent context so it knows *when* to use each resource. The plugin generates a "Community Resources Available" section in CLAUDE.md listing each active resource with its purpose.

#### 4. Upstream Contribution Flow

14. [ ] **Staged contributions**: When an agent calls `community_annotate` or `community_suggest`, the contribution is saved to `.ta/community-staging/<resource>/` as a markdown file. These are included in the draft as artifacts.
15. [ ] **Draft callouts**: Draft view shows community contributions prominently:
    ```
    ── Community Updates ─────────────────────────────────────
    📝 Annotation: api-docs/stripe-payment-intents
       "Missing error handling for `card_declined` — PaymentIntents.create
        returns a CardError with decline_code field, not documented here."

    📄 New doc proposed: api-docs/twilio-verify-v2
       "Complete Twilio Verify v2 API reference with Python/JS examples"
       → On apply: opens PR against github:andrewyng/context-hub

    👍 Feedback: api-docs/openai-embeddings (upvote)
       "Accurate and complete for text-embedding-3-small model"
    ```
16. [ ] **Upstream PR on apply**: When a draft with community contributions is applied (`ta draft apply`), the plugin:
    - Annotations → committed to the upstream resource repo as a PR (if access = read-write)
    - Suggestions → committed as a new content PR with proper frontmatter
    - Feedback → submitted via the resource's feedback mechanism (API call or issue)
    - All contributions include the TA project name as attribution (configurable, can be anonymous)
17. [ ] **Contribution audit trail**: Every community contribution is logged in the audit ledger with: resource name, document ID, contribution type, upstream PR URL (if created), and reviewer who approved the draft.

#### 5. CLI & Shell Integration

18. [ ] **Shell commands**: In `ta shell`, community resources are accessible:
    - `community search <query>` — search across all resources
    - `community get <id>` — fetch and display a document
    - `community list` — show configured resources
    - `community sync` — refresh local caches
19. [ ] **Tab completion**: Resource names and document IDs are tab-completable in the shell.
20. [ ] **Status bar integration**: When the agent is querying community resources, the status bar shows a badge: `[community: searching...]`.

#### Tests

21. [ ] Resource registry parsing and validation (TOML roundtrip, missing fields, access levels)
22. [ ] Intent-based routing dispatches to correct resource
23. [ ] Attribution formatting in agent output
24. [ ] Draft artifact creation for annotations, suggestions, feedback
25. [ ] Access control enforcement (read-only blocks annotate/suggest)
26. [ ] Token budget enforcement and summary generation
27. [ ] Freshness warning for stale documents

#### Version: `0.12.3-alpha`

## v0.13 — Architecture Extensibility

> Internal architecture improvements that enable third-party extension, isolation backends, and governance frameworks. These don't change what TA does for users — they change how it's structured for integrators and downstream projects (SecureTA, Virtual Office). Ordered by dependency chain: compliance audit stands alone, then transport → runtime → governance → proxy, with VCS externalization independent.

### v0.13.0 — Compliance-Ready Audit Ledger
<!-- status: pending -->
<!-- priority: enterprise — deferred; not required for public alpha -->
**Goal**: Replace the lightweight goal history index with a compliance-ready audit ledger that captures full decision context, covers all goal lifecycle paths, and supports pluggable storage backends.

#### Problem
The current `.ta/goal-history.jsonl` is a compact index written only on the happy path (`ta draft apply`). It records *what* happened but not *why*. Multiple lifecycle paths produce no audit record at all:
- `ta goal delete` — data vanishes with no trace
- `ta goal gc` — transitions zombies to `failed` but writes no history entry
- `ta draft deny` / `ta draft close` — no record of the denial or reason
- Agent crash / timeout — goal silently moves to `failed` with a gc reason string

Even on the happy path, the `GoalHistoryEntry` lacks:
- **Intent**: What was the user trying to accomplish (objective, prompt)
- **Summary**: AI-generated summary of what changed and why
- **Decision rationale**: Why this approach was chosen over alternatives
- **Reviewer identity**: Who approved/denied and when
- **Denial reason**: Why a draft was rejected
- **Artifact manifest**: Which files were created/modified/deleted (URIs)
- **Policy evaluation**: Which policies were checked and their pass/fail status

#### Items
1. [ ] **`AuditEntry` data model**: Rich audit record capturing: goal ID, title, objective/intent, final state, phase, agent, timestamps, duration, draft ID, AI summary, reviewer/approver, denial reason, artifact URIs with change types, policy evaluation results, parent goal (for chained goals). Serialized as JSONL.
2. [ ] **Emit audit entry on all terminal transitions**: Every path that ends a goal's lifecycle must write an `AuditEntry`: apply, deny, close, delete, gc, timeout, agent crash. No goal data should be removed without an audit record.
3. [ ] **Separate ledger for deleted incomplete goals**: Goals deleted before producing a draft get a distinct `disposition: "abandoned"` entry with whatever context is available (objective, agent, duration, reason for deletion if provided).
4. [ ] **`ta goal delete --reason`**: Require or prompt for a reason when manually deleting goals. Stored in the audit entry.
5. [ ] **`ta goal gc` writes audit entries**: Before transitioning or removing any goal data, append an audit entry with `disposition: "gc"` and the gc reason.
6. [ ] **Populate artifact count and lines changed**: The existing `GoalHistoryEntry` fields `artifact_count` and `lines_changed` are always 0. Wire them to the draft's actual artifact data.
7. [ ] **`ta audit export`**: Export audit ledger in structured formats (JSONL, CSV, or compliance-specific formats). Filterable by date range, phase, agent, disposition.
8. [ ] **Pluggable audit storage backend**: Use the existing data write plugin architecture to support configurable storage destinations. Config in `daemon.toml`:
   ```toml
   [audit]
   backend = "file"  # default: .ta/audit-ledger.jsonl
   # backend = "database"
   # backend = "s3"
   # connection = "postgres://..."
   # bucket = "my-audit-bucket"
   ```
   Built-in: local JSONL file. Plugin interface for database, shared filesystem, cloud storage.
9. [ ] **Audit ledger integrity**: Append-only with hash chaining (each entry includes hash of previous entry). `ta audit verify` validates the chain. Tampering is detectable.
10. [ ] **Retention policy**: Configurable retention period for audit entries. `ta audit gc --older-than 1y` removes entries beyond retention while preserving chain integrity (tombstone markers).
11. [ ] **Structured agent output logging for compliance**: Optional mode (`[agent].output_log = "structured"` in daemon.toml) that captures full JSON agent output to the audit ledger alongside the human-readable text shown in the shell. Default remains plain text stdout/stderr for the interactive shell; this mode adds a parallel structured log sink for compliance, reproducibility, and post-hoc analysis. The output schema engine (v0.11.2.2) already defines per-agent output formats — this item wires those schemas to the audit pipeline.
12. [ ] **Migration**: Migrate existing `.ta/goal-history.jsonl` entries to the new audit ledger format on first run.

### v0.13.1 — MCP Transport Abstraction (TCP/Unix Socket)
<!-- status: pending -->
<!-- priority: enterprise — SecureTA/container enabler; not required for public alpha; v0.13.2 depends on this -->
**Goal**: Abstract MCP transport so agents can communicate with TA over TCP or Unix sockets, not just stdio pipes. Critical enabler for container-based isolation (SecureTA) and remote agent execution.

#### Items

1. [ ] `TransportLayer` trait: `Stdio`, `UnixSocket`, `Tcp` variants
2. [ ] TCP transport: MCP server listens on configurable port, agent connects over network
3. [ ] Unix socket transport: MCP server creates socket file, agent connects locally (faster than TCP, works across container boundaries via mount)
4. [ ] Transport selection in agent config: `transport = "stdio" | "unix" | "tcp"`
5. [ ] TLS support for TCP transport (optional, for remote agents)
6. [ ] Connection authentication: bearer token exchange on connect
7. [ ] Update `ta run` to configure transport based on runtime adapter

#### Version: `0.13.1-alpha`

---

### v0.13.2 — Runtime Adapter Trait
<!-- status: pending -->
<!-- priority: enterprise — SecureTA/OCI; depends on v0.13.1; not required for public alpha -->
**Goal**: Abstract how TA spawns and manages agent processes. Today it's hardcoded as a bare child process. A `RuntimeAdapter` trait enables container, VM, and remote execution backends — TA provides BareProcess, SecureTA provides OCI/VM.

**Depends on**: v0.13.1 (MCP Transport — runtime adapters need transport abstraction to connect agents over non-stdio channels)

#### Items

1. [ ] `RuntimeAdapter` trait with `spawn()`, `stop()`, `status()`, `attach_transport()` methods
2. [ ] `BareProcessRuntime`: extract current process spawning into this adapter (no behavior change)
3. [ ] Runtime selection in agent/workflow config: `runtime = "process" | "oci" | "vm"`
4. [ ] Plugin-based runtime loading: SecureTA registers OCI/VM runtimes as plugins
5. [ ] Runtime lifecycle events: `AgentSpawned`, `AgentExited`, `RuntimeError` fed into event system
6. [ ] Credential injection API: `RuntimeAdapter::inject_credentials()` for scoped secret injection into runtime environment

#### Version: `0.13.2-alpha`

---

### v0.13.3 — External Action Governance Framework
<!-- status: pending -->
**Goal**: Provide the governance framework for agents performing external actions — sending emails, posting on social media, making API calls, executing financial transactions. TA doesn't implement the actions; it provides the policy, approval, capture, and audit layer so projects like SecureTA or custom workflows can govern them.

**Design**:
- `ExternalAction` trait: defines an action type (email, social post, API call, DB query) with metadata schema
- `ActionPolicy`: per-action-type rules — auto-approve, require human approval, block, rate-limit
- `ActionCapture`: every attempted external action is logged with full payload before execution
- `ActionReview`: captured actions go through the same draft review flow (approve/deny/modify before send)
- Plugins register action types; TA provides the governance pipeline

#### Items

1. [ ] `ExternalAction` trait: `action_type()`, `payload_schema()`, `validate()`, `execute()` — plugins implement this
2. [ ] `ActionPolicy` config in `.ta/workflow.toml`: per-action-type rules (auto, review, block, rate-limit)
3. [ ] `ActionCapture` log: every attempted action logged with full payload, timestamp, goal context
4. [ ] Review flow integration: captured actions surface in `ta draft view` as "pending external actions" alongside file changes
5. [ ] MCP tool `ta_external_action`: agent calls this to request an external action; TA applies policy before execution
6. [ ] Rate limiting: configurable per-action-type limits (e.g., max 5 emails per goal, max 1 social post per hour)
7. [ ] Dry-run mode: capture and log actions without executing, for testing workflows
8. [ ] Built-in action type stubs: `email`, `social_post`, `api_call`, `db_query` — schema only, no implementation (plugins provide the actual send/post/call logic)

**Config example**:
```toml
[actions.email]
policy = "review"          # require human approval before sending
rate_limit = 10            # max 10 per goal

[actions.social_post]
policy = "review"
rate_limit = 1

[actions.api_call]
policy = "auto"            # auto-approve known API calls
allowed_domains = ["api.stripe.com", "api.github.com"]

[actions.db_query]
policy = "review"          # review all DB mutations
auto_approve_reads = true  # SELECT is fine, INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE needs review
```

#### Version: `0.13.3-alpha`

---

### v0.13.4 — Database Proxy Plugins
<!-- status: pending -->
**Goal**: Plugin-based database proxies that intercept agent DB operations. The agent connects to a local proxy thinking it's a real database; TA captures every query, enforces read/write policies, and logs mutations for review. Plugins provide wire protocol implementations; TA provides the governance framework (v0.13.3).

**Depends on**: v0.13.3 (External Action Governance — DB proxy extends the `ExternalAction` trait)

#### Items

1. [ ] `DbProxyPlugin` trait extending `ExternalAction`: `wire_protocol()`, `parse_query()`, `classify_mutation()`, `proxy_port()`
2. [ ] Proxy lifecycle: TA starts proxy before agent, stops after agent exits
3. [ ] Query classification: READ vs WRITE vs DDL vs ADMIN — policy applied per class
4. [ ] Mutation capture: all write operations logged with full query + parameters in draft audit trail
5. [ ] Replay support: captured mutations can replay against real DB on `ta draft apply`
6. [ ] Reference plugin: `ta-db-proxy-sqlite` — SQLite VFS shim, simplest implementation
7. [ ] Reference plugin: `ta-db-proxy-postgres` — Postgres wire protocol proxy
8. [ ] Future plugins (community): MySQL, MongoDB, Redis

#### Version: `0.13.4-alpha`

### v0.13.5 — VCS Adapter Externalization
<!-- status: pending -->
<!-- priority: pre-alpha — moved earlier; Perforce users need this before public alpha; no dependency on v0.13.1 or v0.13.2 (uses JSON-over-stdio protocol from v0.10.2) -->
**Goal**: Migrate VCS adapters from built-in compiled code to external plugins using the same JSON-over-stdio protocol as channel plugins. Git remains built-in as the zero-dependency fallback. Perforce, SVN, and any future VCS adapters become external plugins that users install when needed.

#### Rationale
Today git, perforce, and svn adapters are compiled into the `ta` binary. This means:
- Every user ships code for VCS systems they don't use
- Adding a new VCS (Plastic SCM, Fossil, Mercurial) requires modifying TA core
- Corporate VCS teams can't ship adapters independently
- The SubmitAdapter trait (v0.9.8.4) already abstracts VCS operations — the wire protocol just needs to cross a process boundary

Channel plugins proved this migration pattern works (Discord went from built-in crate to external plugin in v0.10.2.1). VCS adapters follow the same path.

#### Items
1. [ ] **`ta-submit-*` plugin protocol**: Define the JSON-over-stdio protocol for VCS plugins. Messages: `detect` (auto-detect from project), `exclude_patterns`, `save_state`, `restore_state`, `commit`, `push`, `open_review`, `revision_id`. Same request/response structure as channel plugins.
2. [ ] **Plugin discovery for VCS adapters**: When `submit.adapter = "perforce"`, TA checks built-in adapters first, then looks for `ta-submit-perforce` in `.ta/plugins/vcs/`, `~/.config/ta/plugins/vcs/`, and `$PATH`.
3. [ ] **Extract PerforceAdapter to external plugin**: Move `crates/ta-submit/src/perforce.rs` logic into `plugins/ta-submit-perforce/` as a standalone Rust binary. Communicates via JSON-over-stdio. Include `plugin.toml` manifest.
4. [ ] **Extract SvnAdapter to external plugin**: Same treatment for `svn.rs` → `plugins/ta-submit-svn/`.
5. [ ] **GitAdapter stays built-in**: Git is the overwhelmingly common case. Keep it compiled in as the zero-configuration default. It also serves as the reference implementation for the protocol.
6. [ ] **VCS plugin manifest (`plugin.toml`)**: Same schema as channel plugins but with `type = "vcs"` and `capabilities = ["commit", "push", "review", ...]`.
7. [ ] **Adapter version negotiation**: On first contact, TA sends `{"method": "handshake", "params": {"ta_version": "...", "protocol_version": 1}}`. Plugin responds with its version and supported protocol version. TA refuses plugins with incompatible protocol versions.
8. [ ] **Test: external VCS plugin lifecycle**: Integration test with a mock VCS plugin (shell script that speaks the protocol) verifying detect → save_state → commit → restore_state flow.
9. [ ] **§15 compliance — carry forward to plugins**: The built-in Perforce and SVN adapters will already implement `protected_submit_targets()` and `verify_not_on_protected_target()` (added in v0.11.7). When extracting to plugins, port those implementations into the plugin binary and expose them via the JSON-over-stdio protocol (`protected_targets` and `verify_target` messages).
10. [ ] **§15 compliance — plugin registry enforcement**: When loading any submit adapter plugin, validate that `protected_submit_targets()` and `verify_not_on_protected_target()` are consistent. Emit `tracing::warn!` if an adapter declares protected targets but verify is a no-op. Add to `plugin.toml` capabilities: `"protected_targets"` to signal §15 compliance.

#### Version: `0.13.5-alpha`

### v0.13.6 — Shell Mouse Scroll & TUI-Managed Selection (revisit)
<!-- status: pending -->
<!-- priority: deferred — may drop TUI entirely; web shell is default; low user impact -->
**Goal**: Re-examine mouse scroll and TUI-managed text selection in the terminal TUI shell (now opt-in via `ta shell --tui`). v0.11.4.2 attempted mouse capture but it broke native selection. The web shell is now the default, so this is lower priority — only matters for users who prefer the terminal TUI.

#### Research & approach

1. [ ] **Survey Rust TUI apps**: Study how `helix`, `zellij`, `gitui`, `bottom`, `lazygit` handle mouse scroll + text selection simultaneously. Document which ANSI modes each uses.

2. [ ] **Test `?1000h` alone across terminals**: `?1000h` (normal tracking) captures scroll wheel. Does it break native selection in Terminal.app, iTerm2, Windows Terminal, GNOME Terminal, Alacritty, Kitty, WezTerm?

3. [ ] **Test `?1007h` (alternate scroll mode)**: Does it reliably convert scroll wheel to Up/Down arrow keys?

4. [ ] **Evaluate hybrid approach**: Enable `?1000h` + `?1002h` for TUI-managed selection + scroll. Implement click-drag selection with auto-copy via `pbcopy`/`xclip`/`clip.exe`.

5. [ ] **Mouse mode toggle**: User-configurable `[shell] mouse_mode = "native" | "tui"` with `native` as default.

6. [ ] **Scroll wheel without capture**: Investigate terminal-specific protocols for scroll-only capture.

**Files**: `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/shell_tui.rs`

### v0.14.0 — Goal Workflows: Serial Chains, Parallel Swarms & Office Routing
<!-- status: pending -->
**Goal**: Connect goals to workflows so that *how* a goal executes is configurable per-project, per-department, or per-invocation — not hardcoded into `ta run`. Today every goal is a single agent in a single staging directory. This phase introduces workflow-driven execution: serial phase chains, parallel agent swarms, and a routing layer that maps goals to the right workflow based on project config, department, or explicit flag.

#### Problem
1. **Multi-phase work is manual**: Building v0.11.3 requires `ta run` → review draft → `ta run --follow-up` → review → repeat. Each cycle is a manual step. There's no way to say "execute phases 11.3 through 11.5 in sequence, building/testing each, with one PR at the end."
2. **No parallelism**: A plan with 5 independent items runs them one at a time. There's no way to decompose a goal into concurrent sub-goals, have agents work in parallel, then merge.
3. **Workflow selection is implicit**: Every `ta run` uses the same execution model. A coding project wants build→test→review cycles. A content project wants draft→edit→publish. A legal review wants sequential approval chains. There's no way to attach different execution patterns to different kinds of work.
4. **Office structure has no workflow routing**: The `ta office` concept manages multiple projects, but there's no way to say "engineering goals use the serial-phase workflow, marketing goals use the content pipeline, compliance goals use the approval chain."

#### Architecture: Goal → Workflow Routing

The core abstraction is a **workflow router** that sits between `ta run` and execution:

```
ta run "goal" --workflow <name>     # explicit
ta run "goal"                       # uses project/department default
```

**Routing resolution order:**
1. `--workflow <name>` flag on `ta run` (explicit override)
2. Goal's plan phase → phase metadata → workflow (phase-level default)
3. Project config `.ta/config.yaml` → `default_workflow` (project-level default)
4. Office department config → department → workflow mapping (office-level default)
5. Built-in `single-agent` workflow (backwards-compatible default)

**Workflow definition** (`.ta/workflows/<name>.yaml`):
```yaml
name: serial-phases
description: Execute plan phases in sequence with build/test gates
steps:
  - type: goal-run          # run agent in staging
    gate: build-and-test    # must pass before next step
  - type: follow-up         # reuse staging, next phase
    gate: build-and-test
  - type: draft-build       # single PR for all phases
    gate: human-review
```

#### Track 1: Serial Phase Chains (`serial-phases` workflow)

Chain multiple phases into one execution. Each phase runs → builds → tests → if green, the next phase starts as a follow-up in the same staging. One draft/PR at the end.

**Planning items** (detailed design deferred to implementation):
1. [ ] **Workflow engine integration with `ta run`**: `ta run` accepts `--workflow` and delegates to the workflow engine (v0.10.5 `ta-workflow` crate) instead of directly spawning an agent. The workflow engine manages step sequencing, gate evaluation, and error handling.
2. [ ] **`serial-phases` built-in workflow**: Workflow definition that takes a list of phases (or a range), runs each as a follow-up goal in the same staging, with configurable gates between steps (build, test, clippy, custom command).
3. [ ] **Gate evaluation**: After each phase, run the gate command(s). If a gate fails, the workflow pauses and surfaces the failure to the user (via shell notification + SSE event). User can fix and resume, or abort.
4. [ ] **Automatic follow-up chaining**: The workflow engine manages the `--follow-up-goal` chain automatically. Each step reuses the previous step's staging. No manual intervention between phases.
5. [ ] **Single-PR output**: When all phases complete, the workflow builds one draft covering all changes. The draft summary aggregates per-phase summaries.
6. [ ] **Resume/retry on failure**: If a phase fails, `ta run --resume` picks up from the failed step. The workflow engine persists step state.

#### Track 2: Parallel Agent Swarms (`swarm` workflow)

Decompose a goal into independent sub-goals, run them in parallel (separate staging dirs), then an integrator agent merges the results.

**Planning items** (detailed design deferred to implementation):
7. [ ] **Goal decomposition**: The swarm workflow accepts a macro goal and a decomposition strategy (manual list of sub-goals, or agent-generated decomposition from a plan phase).
8. [ ] **Parallel staging**: Each sub-goal gets its own staging directory (standard overlay). Agents work concurrently without conflicts.
9. [ ] **Per-agent validation**: Each agent runs its own build/test gate on completion. Failed sub-goals are flagged but don't block others.
10. [ ] **Integration agent**: After all sub-goals complete (or a quorum), an integration agent receives all sub-goal drafts and merges them into the main staging. It resolves conflicts, runs the full test suite, and builds the final draft.
11. [ ] **Dependency graph**: Sub-goals can declare dependencies (e.g., "sub-goal B needs sub-goal A's output"). The swarm scheduler respects ordering constraints while maximizing parallelism.
12. [ ] **Progress dashboard**: `ta shell` shows swarm status: which sub-goals are running, completed, failed. Visual progress in the status bar.

#### Track 3: Office Workflow Routing

Map departments, project types, or goal categories to default workflows.

**Planning items** (detailed design deferred to implementation):
13. [ ] **Department → workflow mapping in office config**: `.ta/office.yaml` gains a `departments` section that maps department names to default workflows:
    ```yaml
    departments:
      engineering:
        default_workflow: serial-phases
        projects: [api-server, web-client]
      content:
        default_workflow: editorial-pipeline
        projects: [docs, blog]
    ```
14. [ ] **Project-level workflow default**: `.ta/config.yaml` gains `default_workflow: <name>`. Used when no explicit `--workflow` and no department mapping applies.
15. [ ] **Workflow library**: Ship built-in workflows (`single-agent`, `serial-phases`, `swarm`, `approval-chain`). Users can create custom workflows in `.ta/workflows/` using the same YAML schema.
16. [ ] **`ta workflow list`**: Show available workflows (built-in + custom) with descriptions.
17. [ ] **`ta run` routing integration**: Wire the routing resolution order into `ta run`. Log which workflow was selected and why.

#### Open Questions (resolve during implementation)
- **Agent coordination protocol**: How do swarm agents communicate? Shared memory store? File-based? Event bus?
- **Conflict resolution strategy**: When the integration agent merges parallel work, what happens with conflicts? Auto-resolve? Human intervention? Agent negotiation?
- **Workflow versioning**: Do workflows need versioning for reproducibility?
- **Cross-project workflows**: Can an office workflow span multiple projects (e.g., "update API + update client")?
- **Cost/resource limits**: Parallel swarms can be expensive. Should there be concurrency limits per project/office?

#### Version: `0.14.0-alpha`

### v0.14.1 — Product Constitution Framework
<!-- status: pending -->
**Goal**: Make the constitution a first-class, configurable artifact that downstream projects declare, extend, and enforce — not a TA-internal concept hard-wired to `docs/TA-CONSTITUTION.md`. A project using TA can define its own invariants (what functions inject, what functions restore, what the rules are), and TA's draft-build scan and release checklist gate read from that config.

**Problem**: Currently the constitution is TA-specific. The §4 injection/cleanup rules, the pattern scanner, and the release checklist all reference TA's own codebase conventions. A downstream project using TA (e.g., a web service or a data pipeline) has different injection patterns, different error paths, and different invariants. They get no constitution enforcement at all.

#### Architecture: `constitution.toml`

A project-level constitution config in `.ta/constitution.toml`:

```toml
[rules.injection_cleanup]
# Functions that inject context into the workspace (must be cleaned up on all error paths)
inject_fns = ["inject_config", "inject_credentials"]
restore_fns = ["restore_config", "restore_credentials"]
severity = "high"

[rules.error_paths]
# Error return patterns that must be preceded by cleanup
patterns = ["return Err(", "return Ok(()) # error"]
severity = "medium"

[scan]
# Files/dirs to scan for constitution violations
include = ["src/"]
exclude = ["src/tests/"]
on_violation = "warn"   # "warn" | "block" | "off"

[release]
# Whether to include a constitution compliance gate in the release pipeline
checklist_gate = true
# Whether to run parallel agent constitution review during release
agent_review = false   # opt-in — spins up a lighter concurrent review agent

[agent_review]
# Prompt prefix for the constitution reviewer (lighter than full release notes agent)
model_hint = "fast"    # hint to use a smaller/faster model
max_tokens = 2000
focus = "injection_cleanup,error_paths"
```

#### Items

1. [ ] **`constitution.toml` schema**: Define and document the config format. Ship TA's own rules as the default template (generated by `ta init constitution`).

2. [ ] **`ta init constitution`**: Scaffolding command. Writes `.ta/constitution.toml` with TA's default rules as a starting point. Users edit for their project's patterns.

3. [ ] **Draft-time scanner reads `constitution.toml`**: Move the hardcoded §4 pattern scan (v0.11.5 item 8) to read inject/restore function names from `constitution.toml`. Projects with different conventions get correct scanning.

4. [ ] **Release pipeline reads `checklist_gate`**: The release checklist gate step (v0.11.4.4 item 9) is enabled/disabled by `constitution.toml`. The checklist content is generated from the declared rules, not hardcoded.

5. [ ] **Parallel agent review during release**: When `agent_review = true` in `constitution.toml`, the release pipeline fans out two agents concurrently: the existing release notes writer, and a lighter constitution reviewer. The reviewer gets the diff + the declared rules + a compact prompt. Its output is appended to the release draft as a "Constitution Review" section. Uses `model_hint = "fast"` to keep it cheap. Opt-in because it adds an LLM call per release.

6. [ ] **`ta constitution check`**: CLI command to run the scan outside of draft build — useful for CI integration and pre-commit hooks. Exit code 0 = clean, 1 = violations found. Output is machine-readable JSON with `--json` flag.

7. [ ] **Inheritance**: `constitution.toml` can `extends = "ta-default"` to inherit TA's rules and only override specific sections. TA ships a built-in `ta-default` profile.

8. [ ] **Documentation**: "How to write a constitution for your project" guide in `docs/`. Includes worked example for a web service with DB migration injection patterns.

**Files**: `.ta/constitution.toml` (new), `apps/ta-cli/src/commands/` (init, check, draft build scan, release step), `crates/ta-workspace/src/` (scanner crate or module).

## Projects On Top (separate repos, built on TA)

> These are NOT part of TA core. They are independent projects that consume TA's extension points.
> See `docs/ADR-product-concept-model.md` for how they integrate.

### TA Web UI *(separate project)*
> Lightweight web frontend for non-engineers to use TA without the CLI.

A browser-based interface to TA's daemon API, aimed at users who need to start goals, review drafts, and respond to agent questions without touching a terminal. Same capabilities as `ta shell` but with a guided, form-based experience.

- **Thin client**: SPA consuming TA's existing HTTP API + SSE events. No new backend logic.
- **Non-engineer language**: "Review changes", "Approve", "Ask the agent a question" — not "draft", "artifact", "overlay".
- **Dashboard**: Active goals, pending reviews, pending agent questions. One-glance status.
- **Start Goal**: Form with title, description, agent dropdown, optional file upload. Sensible defaults, optional advanced toggle.
- **Goal Detail**: Live agent output via SSE, state transitions, conversation history (interactive mode Q&A).
- **Draft Review**: Side-by-side diff viewer, file tree, AI summary. Approve/deny/comment buttons. Selective approval per file.
- **Agent Questions**: Pending questions with response input. Browser push notifications.
- **History**: Past goals/drafts, searchable, filterable.
- **Tech stack**: React or Svelte SPA, served as static files by daemon (`GET /ui/*`). Auth via daemon API token or session login.
- **Extensible**: Plugin mount points at `/ui/ext/<plugin-name>` for custom pages. Configurable theme/branding via `daemon.toml`.
- **Mobile-friendly**: Responsive layout for on-the-go approvals from phone/tablet.

**TA dependencies**: Daemon HTTP API (exists), SSE events (exists), interactive mode (v0.9.9.x), static file serving from daemon (minor addition to `ta-daemon`).

### Virtual Office Runtime *(separate project)*
> Thin orchestration layer that composes TA, agent frameworks, and MCP servers.

- Role definition schema (YAML): purpose, triggers, agent, capabilities, notification channel
- Trigger system: cron scheduler + webhook receiver + TA event listener
- Office manager daemon: reads role configs, routes triggers, calls `ta run`
- Multi-agent workflow design with detailed agent guidance
- Smart security plan generation → produces `AlignmentProfile` + `AccessConstitution` YAML consumed by TA
- Constitutional auto-approval active by default
- **Compliance dashboard**: ISO/IEC 42001, EU AI Act evidence package
- Domain workflow templates (sw-engineer, email, finance, etc.)

### Autonomous Infra Ops *(separate project)*
> Builder intent → best-practice IaC, self-healing with observability.

- Builder intent language → IaC generation (Terraform, Pulumi, CDK)
- TA mediates all infrastructure changes (ResourceMediator for cloud APIs)
- Self-healing loop: observability alerts → agent proposes fix → TA reviews → apply
- Best-practice templates for common infrastructure patterns
- Cost-aware: TA budget limits enforce infrastructure spend caps

## Supervision Frequency: TA vs Standard Agent Usage

> How often does a user interact with TA compared to running Claude/Codex directly?

| Mode | Standard Claude/Codex | TA-mediated |
|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Active coding** | Continuous back-and-forth. ~100% attention. | Fluid session: agent works, human reviews in real-time. ~10-20% attention. |
| **Overnight/batch** | Not possible — agent exits when session closes. | `ta run --checkpoint` in background. Review next morning. 0% attention during execution. |
| **Auto-approved (v0.6)** | N/A | Supervisor handles review within constitutional bounds. User sees daily summary. ~1% attention. Escalations interrupt. |
| **Virtual office** | N/A | Roles run on triggers. User reviews when notified. Minutes per day for routine workflows. |

**Key shift**: Standard agent usage demands synchronous human attention. TA shifts to fluid, asynchronous review — the agent works independently, the human reviews in real-time or retroactively. Trust increases over time as constitutional auto-approval proves reliable.

---

## Future Improvements (unscheduled)

> Ideas that are valuable but not yet prioritized into a release phase. Pull into a versioned phase when ready.

### OCI/gVisor Container Isolation (from v0.9.2)
Enterprise-grade sandbox using OCI containers with gVisor for kernel-level agent isolation. The `ta-sandbox` crate provides command allowlists and CWD enforcement; OCI adds true process isolation with network/filesystem namespace separation.

### Enterprise State Intercept (from v0.9.2)
See `docs/enterprise-state-intercept.md`. Allows enterprises to intercept and audit all agent state transitions for compliance.

### External Plugin System
Process-based plugin architecture so third parties can publish TA adapters as independent packages. A Perforce vendor, JIRA integration company, or custom VCS provider can ship a `ta-submit-<name>` executable that TA discovers and communicates with via JSON-over-stdio protocol. Extends beyond VCS to any adapter type: notification channels (`ta-channel-slack`), storage backends (`ta-store-postgres`), output integrations (`ta-output-jira`). Includes `ta plugin install/list/remove` commands, a plugin manifest format, and a plugin registry (crates.io or TA-hosted). Design sketched in v0.9.8.4; implementation deferred until the in-process adapter pattern is validated.

### Community Memory Sync
Federated sharing of anonymized problem→solution pairs across TA instances. Builds on v0.8.1 (Solution Memory Export) with:
- **Community sync layer**: Publish anonymized entries to a shared registry (hosted service or federated protocol).
- **Privacy controls**: Tag-based opt-in, never auto-publish. PII stripping before publish. User reviews every entry before it leaves the local machine.
- **Retrieval**: `ta context recall` searches local first, then community if opted in.
- **Provenance tracking**: Did this solution actually work when applied downstream? Feedback loop from consumers back to publishers.
- **Trust model**: Reputation scoring for contributors. Verified solutions (applied successfully N times) ranked higher.
- **Spam/quality**: Moderation queue for new contributors. Automated quality checks (is the problem statement clear? is the solution actionable?).
