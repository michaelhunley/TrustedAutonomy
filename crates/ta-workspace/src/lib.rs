//! # ta-workspace
//!
//! Staging workspace manager for Trusted Autonomy.
//!
//! Manages ephemeral temp directories where agents stage filesystem changes.
//! Changes are tracked via a [`ChangeStore`] trait — the MVP implementation
//! ([`JsonFileStore`]) persists to JSONL on disk so work is never lost.
//! The trait can be swapped for SQLite or other backends later.
//!
//! ## Key components
//!
//! - [`StagingWorkspace`] — ephemeral temp directory where files are staged
//!   before review. Tracks original snapshots for diff generation.
//! - [`ChangeStore`] — trait abstracting changeset persistence. Lets us swap
//!   backends (JSONL → SQLite → S3) without changing callers.
//! - [`JsonFileStore`] — MVP implementation: one JSONL file per goal,
//!   append-optimized, survives process restarts.
